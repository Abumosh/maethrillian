    <str id="DLC4M01_PIP_ROM_FIRSTGOLIATH_DEAD_02">Just when I thought those things couldn&apos;t get any bigger.</str>
    <str id="DLC4M01_PIP_ROM_FORTBASE_01">We&apos;ve got another base, Hellbringers.</str>
    <str id="DLC4M01_PIP_ROM_FORTBASE_02">It&apos;s another of those Hunters, take it down!</str>

    <str id="DLC4M01_PIP_ROM_LARCBASE_06">Let&apos;s just secure the control tower while the area&apos;s clear.</str>
    <str id="DLC4M01_PIP_ROM_LARCBASE_GOLIATH_01">Some kind of Hunter. But bigger than any one I&apos;ve ever seen.</str>
    <str id="DLC4M01_PIP_ROM_LARCBASE_GOLIATH_02">We need some anti-infantry, on the double!</str>

    <str id="DLC4M01_PIP_ROM_SWARMENDS_02">That&apos;s it. Re-engage the Retriever, but watch out for the Swarm!</str>
    <str id="DLC4M01_PIP_ROM_SWARMRETURNS_02">The Swarm is coming right at us!</str>
    <str id="DLC4M01_PIP_ROM_TUTHOLODECOY_01">That&apos;s one more Controller Sentinel taken care of.</str>
