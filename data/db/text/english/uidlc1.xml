	<str id="UIDLC1.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.FLAMECYCLOPS">Kinsano's adapted Cyclops mech-suit.

The Flame Cyclops is a Hero unit unique to Kinsano.  Her one-off armored exoskeleton is equipped with twin flamer units whose limited range is offset by the high damage they inflict, and by the mech’s overall speed, giving impressive area-control. 

A fast-recharging energy shield provides basic defense and an upgrade gives access to the Firewall ability, which creates a static wall of flame very damaging to units passing through it.</str>
	<str id="UIDLC1.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.FLAMEHOG">Fast-attack vehicle with heavy flame projector.

Spitting promethean fire from its flamethrower turret, the Flame Warthog can melt infantry and light armored units with ease. It can also be upgraded with an incendiary grenade launcher loaded with thermobaric rounds. It retains the ram ability common to most Warthogs.

Improving on field-expedient modifications that Kinsano and her team had used in previous campaigns, the current Flame Warthog is armed with either a high-pressure flamethrower or electromagnetic grenade launcher firing thermobaric munitions. Though Cutter allowed their use—with reservations, given Kinsano’s loose interpretation of his rules of engagement—it was Isabel who ultimately approved production allocation of the Flame Warthogs in accordance with modern UNSC biohazard containment protocols and threat assessments she has not yet widely disseminated.</str>
	<str id="UIDLC1.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.FLAMEWARTHOG">Warthog armed with powerful flamer.

The Flame Warthog, or 'Flamehog', is an adapted Warthog only available to Morgan Kinsano. The usual Warthog autocannon has been replaced with a white-burning flamethrower which is particularly effective against infantry and buildings. The passenger also fires anti-air rockets. 

The Flamehog has the same ramming ability as a regular Warthog and an upgrade allows the flamer to be replaced with a grenade launcher with incendiary grenades.</str>
	<str id="UIDLC1.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.KINSANO">The Inferno.

Lieutenant Colonel Morgan Kinsano was once a key insurrectionist leader in the Outer Colonies, leading a political and military campaign against the Unified Earth Government for the independence of her homeworld. Though Kinsano’s world was spared in the initial Covenant invasion, the aliens took almost everything else from her: family, friends, and even old enemies. Joining the UNSC to protect her home was a bitter pill for the political firebrand, but survival trumped all ideology.

Known as “Inferno” to her comrades, Kinsano is not as disciplined as other UNSC officers, but her ruthlessness and inspirational presence makes her one of the most respected Marine leaders aboard the ship. She takes to the field in her personalized Flame Cyclops, leading the Firestorm Battle Group, a strike force of ODSTs, Marines, and Hellbringers that specialize in delivering promethean fire to the enemies of humanity.</str>
	<str id="UIDLC1.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.KINSANO">Insurrectionist firebrand turned UNSC leader.

Kinsano specializes in flame-based attacks, with an emphasis on destruction and area denial. Her arsenal includes a Flame Cyclops suit that she can use as a Hero in the field, and a specially-adapted Warthog equipped with a white-burning anti-armor flamer.

Morgan Kinsano was a key insurrectionist leader in the outer colonies when the Covenant attacked, sparking the Human-Covenant war, and she saw fellow fighters and family members alike cut down by the unstoppable Covenant war machine. 

The Covenant war scattered the insurrection movement and she signed up to join the UNSC, realizing that if the Covenant killed everyone she wouldn’t have an insurrection to come back to. Her politics and approach to combat might be unusual for the UNSC, but her ruthless fighting style and unorthodox tactics have saved many lives.</str>
	<str id="UIDLC1.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.KINSANOCYCLOPS">The Incinerator.

Kinsano’s unorthodox fusion of ODST and Hellbringer tactics extends to her use of a customized Flame Cyclops. Nicknamed “Incinerator,” her personal Cyclops is an armored infantry exoskeleton fitted with extremely powerful flamethrowers that project armor-melting promethean fire. Through some inspired favor-trading and “borrowing” of unguarded supplies she has acquired a number of upgrades for this suit, including the aptly-named Flamewall ability, High-Torque Joints to increase her assault speed, and increased Tank Capacity to produce even larger walls of fire.

Though Kinsano jealously guards her hand-crafted war machine, several junior officers in the Firestorm Battle Group have an unofficial competition to assemble and test their own variants of the Flame Cyclops to join her on the battlefield. Not one to be upstaged, Kinsano is already looking into incorporating new Covenant and Banished tech into the Incinerator that will further increase its combat power.</str>
