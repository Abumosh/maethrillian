	<str id="M08_AND_PU_TO_SHIELD_GENERATOR_01">I have full control of the Retriever! Get to the shield generator, Red Team, and I'll clear the way.</str>
	<str id="M08_CALLOUT_TEX_SHIELD_GENERTOR_01">Shield generator</str>
	<str id="M08_COMMS_IGC_SPAA_SCARABINCOMING_01">Stay on target, Professor. This is what we're here for.</str>
	<str id="M08_COMMS_IGC_SPAD_SCARABINCOMING_01">We’ve got an incoming Scarab, people!</str>
	<str id="M08_COMMS_IGC_SPAJ_BANISHEDINCOMING_01">Lock and load. No-one crosses that line.</str>
	<str id="M08_COMMS_KODIA_BARRIER_01">Red Team, we have hostiles at the barrier! Won't be able to hold it for long!</str>
	<str id="M08_COMMS_SPAA_RETRIEVERREPELLED_01">That wasn’t easy.</str>
	<str id="M08_IGC_PIP_CUT_FINALFIGHT_01">Our troops are clear, Professor. Whatever you're going to do, do it now.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_ALLTOWERSCAPTURED_01">I'm in, but I'm going to need some time to calibrate everything.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_BANISHEDONSLAUGHT_01">It's...complicated. So many protocols. I'm probably halfway there, I need more time.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_BANISHEDTAKINGEMITTERS_01">Red Team, we can't let the Banished take those points! We only have a limited time until that Halo leaves!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_FIRSTEMITTERCAPTURED_01">Okay, that's opened up the system to me, but I'm still locked out from the full solution. If you take the other towers, I will be able to get control faster!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_NEARLYDEADWARNING_01">I'm in trouble, I need help!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_NEARLYDEADWARNING_02">The shield's nearly down, I won't be able to hold them back!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_NEARLYDEADWARNING_03">The Banished are breaking through the shield!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_REINFORCEMENTSINTRO_02">We'll be sending in reinforcements directly from the ship just as soon as they're ready to deploy</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_RETRIEVER_APPEARS_01">The installation has released a Retriever! They're the Ark's most powerful sentinels!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_RETRIEVER_WARNING_01">Be on the lookout for that Retriever, it'll consider everyone here a threat!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_RETRIEVER_WARNING_02">Careful, that Retriever won't discriminate between us and the Banished!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_RETRIEVER_WARNING_03">Watch out, the Retriever is nearby, stay out of it's way!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_RETRIEVER_WARNING_04">Heads up, the Retriever is close by!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_RETRIEVER_WARNING_05">The Retriever's in the vicinity, keep clear!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_RETRIEVERREPELLED_01">It's only retreated for repairs. It'll be back soon.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_SCARABINCOMING_01">What?</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_SECONDEMITTERCAPTURED_01">That's helped speed things up, Jerome, I'm getting closer to taking control.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_SHIELDATTACKED_01">They're trying to destroy the shield! I can't disarm this thing if I'm dead!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_SHIELDDOWN_01">We’re in!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_SHIELDEMITTERS_01">All the more reason to gain control over that Retriever. You've got to secure those towers for me.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_SHIELDNEARLYGONE_01">They've almost destroyed the shield!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_SOLUTION_01">The communications array is ready, Captain, but you said it yourself…we can't leave until the Banished are gone? I've found something down here that'll help.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_THREESCARABS_01">I've gained control of the Halo's gravity anchors, Captain. Get our troops clear and get ready.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_UNDERATTACKWARNING_01">I'm under attack! Need a little help here!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_UNDERATTACKWARNING_03">It sounds like the Banished are trying to punch through the shield! I need some help here!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_AND_UNDERATTACKWARNING_04">The Banished are attacking the Control Room, it's a little distracting!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_COND_ORDER_ATTACK_02_BSL03">Payback time. Make it hurt, guys.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_COND_ORDER_UNIT_SELECT_06">My crew is ready for action, sir.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_BANISHEDONSLAUGHT_01">What’s the status, Professor?</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_BANISHEDONSLAUGHT_02">Make it fast, Professor.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_BLISTERBACKATTACK_01">Watch out, team. The Banished have sent in artillery!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_BOTHANCHORS_01">We're counting on you, Professor. Jerome, hold the Control Room at all costs so the Professor can get back to us when she’s done. I’m not leaving anybody behind.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_FAILSTATE_01">We've lost the Control Room,team. We've failed.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_MOVEOUT_01">Regroup everyone you can, but the priority is getting to that Control Room and disarming the Halo before it heads towards human space.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_NEARLYDEADWARNING_01">Focus on protecting the Professor!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_NEARLYDEADWARNING_02">Stop them reaching the Professor at all costs!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_OPTIONALBANISHEDBASE_01">Good work. That will reduce the amount of Banished reinforcements on the battlefield.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_PLAYERLOSTEMITTERS_01">We've failed. The ring is now under Atriox's control.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_REINFORCEMENTSPROMPT_01">Red Team, reinforcements are ready for you at the LZ.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_REINFORCEMENTSPROMPT_02">We've got reinforcements for you now, Red Team.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_REINFORCEMENTSPROMPT_03">We have reinforcements standing by for you, Red Team.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_REINFORCEMENTSPROMPT_04">Reinforcements ready for your command, Red Team.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_SAVEDBRAVOBASE_01">Good work, Red Team. We're going to need all the support we can get.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_SCARABNEARLYDEAD_01">Professor? What's the plan?</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_SCRAMBLECONDORS_01">Scramble everything we've got!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_THREESCARABS_01">Professor? Time is running out!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_UNDERATTACKWARNING_01">Protect the Professor! She needs time to disarm the Halo!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_UNDERATTACKWARNING_02">Don't let them break through to the Control Room, team! If we lose the Professor, we lose everything!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_CUT_WARLORDINTRO_01">Red Team, the Banished have Warlords on the field overseeing their troops. Eliminating them will disrupt the Banished's chain of command.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_AND_ASSAULTANCHORS_01">Well, that's a little more complicated. I'm going to have to go down into the ring to set up the beacon. I'm going to need a little more time.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_AND_BASEBUILT_02">This Control Room has a defensive shield, but it won't last long. You just keep the wolves at bay.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_AND_CROWBAR_01">Stand back, let's see what our new friend can do!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_AND_RETRIEVERFRIENDLY_01">But this time it's under our control - for now anyway.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_AND_RETRIEVERINTRO_01">Heightened security protocols kicked in as soon as the Halo left the Ark, but that may work in our favor.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_AND_RETRIEVERINTRO_SPLIT_01">I've marked three control towers. If you can secure those, I should be able to take control of the Retriever. Until then, keep out of its way!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_AND_SCARABSBEATEN_01">Just finishing up, hang on...okay, I’ve done it! The ring’s disarmed and the communications relay is in place!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_ATR_ATRIOXANGRY_01">You think you can stand against me? I, who defied the Covenant itself!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_ATR_INTRO_01">Captain. Your troops fight with a tenacity that almost matches my Jiralhanae brothers. I'm impressed.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_ATR_INTRO_02">Hahahaha! Luck! Treachery! These are the only reasons you still live, Cutter! Very well, I admire your spirit, captain, but you’ve just sentenced your little ship to oblivion.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_ATR_INTROOFFER_01">You and I are survivors, and I respect that, so I offer you a boon: Take your troops, take your ship, leave now and I will not hunt you down.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_COND_CONDORINTRO_01">Where do you need us, sir?</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_ATRIOXANGRY_01">Put him through.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_ATRIOXANGRY_02">Here’s your notice, Atriox. The Ark is our home now and it's under our protection. Cut it, Isabel. I've heard enough.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_BANISHEDBASEDESTROYED_02">This is it, team. Get ready to defend the Control Room. The Professor has to go down into the ring to deactivate its weapons systems and set up the comms beacon.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_BANISHEDBASEDESTROYED_SPLIT_02">The Banished aren't going to give us much time before they they throw everything they have at us. Be ready when they do.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_BANISHEDINCOMING_01">There's a massive influx of Banished heading to your position, team.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_BASEBUILT_02">Red Team, you have to hold the Banished back until the Professor's done her work.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_CONDORINTRO_01">Target that Scarab, we can’t let it reach the Control Room.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_INTRO_01">Did you make the same offer to the people you slaughtered at that outpost? We're not going anywhere.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_INTRO_SPLIT_01">We’re only talking right now because you know I’m going to take this Ark from you.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_SAVEBRAVOBASE_01">Spartans, Bravo base is under attack! If we lose it, we’ll have very little time to rebuild!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_SCARABINCOMING_01">Isabel! What's the status of that new gunship? We need it now!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_SCARABSBEATEN_01">Good work, Professor. What about the communications beacon?</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_CUT_SCARABSBEATEN_02">Whatever it is, it better work, Professor.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_ISA_ATRIOXANGRY_01">Captain, he's back…</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_ISA_ATRIOXANGRY_04">Captain, I didn’t think you could make him any madder, but...</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_ISA_SCARABINCOMING_01">The Condor's on the way, Captain.  Nothing like live combat to test a new design.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAA_INTRO_01">It’s a wonder you stayed alive without me.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAA_INTRO_02">You know me well.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAA_INTRO_03">Who gets to take this one?</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAD_INTRO_01">Stay down!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAD_INTRO_02">Always got to show off, eh, Alice?</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAD_RETRIEVERINTRO_02">Because we didn’t have enough going on.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_BASEBUILT_01">Don't worry, sir. We've got her. And it looks like we've got company right now.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_INTRO_03">I figured you two have had enough fun.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_RETRIEVERFRIENDLY_01">Professor, the Retriever's back!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_RETRIEVERFRIENDLY_02">Keep the area clear for the Professor!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_SCARABSBEATEN_01">Scarab is down. Professor, how are we doing?</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_SCARABSBEATEN_02">Sir, we won’t be able to hold them off indefinitely!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_ISA_USELEADERPOWERS_01">The Spirit of Fire's weapons are at your disposal, Spartan. Get this ship in the fight.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_ISA_USELEADERPOWERS_02">Turrets and restoration drones are online, call in support when you need it.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_ISA_USELEADERPOWERS_03">The Spirit of Fire is standing by to assist, Jerome. Use everything you can, we have to keep the professor safe!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_MARSQ_REGROUP_01">Heads up, troops! Friendlies!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_MARSQ_REGROUP_02">It'll be a pleasure, sir.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_MARSQ_SAVEDBRAVOBASE_01">Thanks for the assist, Red Team! Lead the way!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SCOR_NEW_UNIT_APPEARS_04">Scorpion here and ready for action.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAA_RETRIEVERTEASE_01">I’m going to go out on a limb and say ‘bad news’.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAA_SHIELDEMITTERS_02">You know, just for once I'd like a straight up fight. There's the enemy, shoot the enemy, go home.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAA_WARLORDINTRO_01">Nothing like sowing a little chaos.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAD_RETRIEVERTEASE_01">Uh, what's that sound?</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_ALLTOWERSCAPTURED_01">That's all the towers, Professor.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_AREASECURE_01">Spirit of Fire Actual, we've secured the base, but our forces are scattered.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_BANISHEDONSLAUGHT_01">We’ll buy her the time, sir.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_BOTHANCHORS_01">Copy that, sir. Game faces, team!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_CONDORFIGHT_01">Hit it with everything we’ve got!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_FIRSTEMITTERCAPTURED_01">That's the first tower, Professor.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_HOLDTHELINE_01">Hold the line, Red Team!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_MOVEOUT_03">We'll get it done, sir.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_REGROUP_01">Soldier, captain says you're to join up with us.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_REINFORCEMENTSINTRO_01">Red Team, do everything you can to protect the Professor.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_SAVEBRAVOBASE_01">That's Bravo base and it's under attack! Take it back and clear out the area!</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_SCARABNEARLYDEAD_01">We've got them on the ropes, Captain, but it's only a matter of time before they send more.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_SHIELDBLOCKING_01">Professor, bad news. There's a shield blocking our route through to the Control Room.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_SHIELDEMITTERS_02">Let's focus on securing those towers, Red Team, everyone's counting on us.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_WARLORDINTRO_01">Roger, sir.</str>
	<str id="M08_PIP_SPAJ_WARLORDKILLED_01">Warlord down.</str>
