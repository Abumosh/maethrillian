	<str id="M05_COMMS_IGC_AND_REAVER_INTRO_01">Reaver! Isabel briefed me on them! They're bypassing the ravines! We need to take them out or they'll be at the cannon in no time!</str>
	<str id="M05_COMMS_KODIA_KODIAKCHOKES_02">Acknowledged. Calculating trajectories now.</str>
	<str id="M05_COMMS_SPAD_LIGHT_BRIDGE_DEACTIVATE_01">So long!</str>
	<str id="M05_COMMS_SPAD_LIGHT_BRIDGE_DEACTIVATE_02">Should've packed a chute!</str>

	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_BARRICADELOSING_02">The west barricade is being destroyed, we've got to stop them breaking through!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_BARRICADELOSING_03">We're in danger of losing the west barricade, Douglas!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_BARRICADELOSING_04">They've nearly broken through the west barricade!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_BARRICADELOSING_05">The east barricade is under heavy attack, if we lose it, they'll be able to get through!</str>

	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_BARRICADELOST_02">The west barricade is down! The Banished are coming through!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_BARRICADELOST_03">That's both barricades down, Douglas. We're going to have to fight harder to defend the cannon now!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_CANNON_ATTACKED_01">Douglas, the Particle Cannon is under attack! You've got to push them back!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_CANNON_ATTACKED_02">We've got to protect the particle cannon until it breaks through the shields!</str>

	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_CANNON_DAMAGE_STATE_02">The particle cannon is at twenty-percent integrity! We're going to lose it!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_CANNON_DAMAGE_STATE_03">The particle cannon won't last much longer! If we lose it, we lose everything!</str>

	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_CANNON_WARNING_02">Enemies are closing in on our particle cannon!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_CANNON_WARNING_03">Enemies at the particle cannon! Clear them out!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_CYCLOPSDROP_01">Captain, we could use some help. Requesting a Cyclops drop.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_HEALING_01">The Particle Cannon's taken damage! We need to repair it with restoration drones!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_LIGHTBRIDGE_01">Douglas, the Banished have activated the lightbridge, it'll give them a shorter route to the cannon!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_ODSTDROP_01">Captain, an ODST drop would be appreciated right now.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_POSTWAVETHREE_01">Douglas, the monitors have gone quiet - for now.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_PREP_01">Douglas, I'm starting to get early warning alerts on those monitors. The Banished will be here soon!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_PREP_02">Douglas, that amber looks awfully fragile, could we use that to cut off some of their routes?</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_TURRET_01">We need some defences! Captain, requesting a turret drop!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_01">Douglas, the cannon's nearly broken through the carrier's shields. I just need a little bit longer.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_03">Apparently not…I'm receiving an incoming communication. It's not encrypted -  and it's not UNSC. I'm patching it through.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_04">That was him.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_05">Forget him, we need to focus on...uh oh… on the EVERYTHING they're throwing at us!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_06">Infantry to the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_07">Enemy armor coming from the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_08">More armor, this time from the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_09">Wraiths to the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_10">They're sending in infantry from the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_11">We have a Hunter and infantry coming from the north-east, they're after our base!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_12">More infantry from the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_13">Enemy vehicles inbound from the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_EIGHT_14">Wraiths and Locusts from the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_FIVE_01">The monitors are lit up again - wait, they're coming in from a new route! We've got enemy vehicles inbound from the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_FIVE_03">Enemy armor from the east, Douglas!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_FIVE_04">They're sending in more Ghosts from the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_FIVE_05">Douglas! Another charge of Ghosts from the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_FIVE_06">Douglas! One of their Wraiths is making a beeline for our base!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_FOUR_01">Infantry and enemy armor coming from the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_FOUR_02">Douglas, to the north! The Banished have sent in a couple of Wraiths!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_FOUR_03">More vehicles to the north-east! They've got a Locust!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_FOUR_04">Another Wraith incoming from the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_FOUR_05">Enemy vehicles inbound from the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_ONE_01">Here they come! Infantry coming in from the north!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_ONE_02">More ground troops coming in from the north!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_ONE_03">Douglas, we've got Hunters coming from the north!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_POSTEIGHTUPDATE_02">We're very close to punching through, hang on, we’re almost there!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SEVEN_01">Infantry coming from the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SEVEN_02">Jump Brutes to the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SEVEN_03">Uh oh, we've got a wave of suicide grunts coming from the north-east.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SEVEN_04">Jump Brutes coming from the north, they're heading towards our base!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SEVEN_05">Suicide Grunts inbound from the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SIX_01">Monitors show enemy vehicles coming from the east.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SIX_02">They're sending in a Locust from the east to attack our base!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SIX_03">More vehicles from the east, they've got heavy armor this time!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SIX_06">Ghosts and Wraiths inbound from the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SIX_07">Douglas, we've got Wraiths coming from the east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_SIX_08">Ground troops coming in from the east, heading directly towards our base. Looks like they're support for a Locust strike!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_THREE_01">Douglas, you have enemy infantry coming in, this time from the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_THREE_02">Hunters and infantry to the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_THREE_03">Infantry inbound from the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_THREE_04">More infantry from the north-east!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_TWO_01">We have more infantry inbound from the north!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_AND_WAVE_TWO_02">Douglas, Hunters to the north!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_ATR_WAVE_EIGHT_01">Ah, little Spartan - I see you've recovered from our introduction. It seems you need another 'lesson'.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_CUT_WAVE_NINE_01">Douglas, Professor! The Shipmaster has diverted some of his air units from the attack on the Spirit of Fire. They're heading your way.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_AND_CANNON_FIRES_01">I can overload the cannon and deliver one huge final blast, but it'll completely shut it down afterwards.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_AND_CANNON_FIRES_02">Here goes.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_AND_CANNON_FIRES_03">It worked! The shields are down!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_AND_PARTICLE_CANNON_02">Hard to estimate, Captain, this thing didn't exactly come with instructions. I'll draw as much power as I can into the cannon, but we're going to make one heck of a target.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_AND_PARTICLE_CANNON_03">I've set up monitoring equipment along each of the possible routes, so I can alert Douglas as the Banished arrive.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_CUT_CANNON_FIRES_01">Professor, Jerome and Isabel don’t have much more time. We need that shield down now.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_CUT_CANNON_FIRES_02">Do it. We want that cannon scuttled anyway so the Banished can't use it against us if things don’t go according to plan.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_CUT_PARTICLE_CANNON_01">That’s a confirmed hit, Professor. The Enduring Conviction is immobilized and not going anywhere. What’s the ETA on full penetration of its shields?</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_CUT_PARTICLE_CANNON_02">Agreed. Douglas, the Banished carrier is Atriox's biggest weapon and only means of slipstream transport, so he'll be sending everything he can to destroy that cannon.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_CUT_PARTICLE_CANNON_03">And with Atriox redirecting all his forces your way, he'll be leaving the base beneath the carrier relatively clear, giving Jerome and Isabel a chance to infiltrate it.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_CUT_PARTICLE_CANNON_SPLIT_03">They'll be standing by for word when you've broken through the carrier's shields. Hold the line, team.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_SPAD_CANNON_FIRES_01">Nice shooting, Professor! Get ready for extraction back to the Spirit of Fire. Jerome, this is Douglas. The shield is down and you are a go.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_SPAD_PARTICLE_CANNON_01">Now that we've crippled their portals, the Banished will have to make a traditional frontal assault using whatever local forces they have.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_SPAD_PARTICLE_CANNON_02">To reach the cannon, the Banished will have to pass through those choke points to the east and west, so we've set up UNSC barriers there to defend them.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_SPAD_PARTICLE_CANNON_SPLIT_02">We need to make sure they hold fast.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_ROGER_01">Roger that, Douglas. Now get your troops clear. You don't want to be down there when Isabel gets started.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_KODIAKCHOKES_01">Kodiaks One and Two, this is Douglas. Stop as many as you can from reaching the east and west barriers. Stay alert.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_LIGHTBRIDGE_01">Got it, Professor. I'll see what I can do.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_PREP_01">Jerome, this is Douglas. We've got a confirmed hit on the carrier's shield. It's going to take a while to punch through but it's working.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_PREP_03">Way ahead of you.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_EIGHT_02">Sure thing, Professor. Think they've taken enough punishment yet?</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_EIGHT_03">Atriox.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_EIGHT_04">Good. I've got some anger to work off.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_FIVE_02">These guys are relentless! I can see how they managed to survive the Covenant during the war!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_FIVE_07">If we lose that, we won't be able to hold the line. Let's make sure that doesn't happen.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_FOUR_01">Roger that, Anders. Target those Wraiths, troops! We can't let them through!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_FOUR_03">They'll wreck our barricades in no time. Let's head them off, fast!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_NINE_02">We need to get some anti-air defenses, ASAP! Turrets! Wolverines!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_ONE_04">Hunters? Make sure our Kodiaks are protected!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_POSTEIGHTUPDATE_01">What's the status on that shield? It's Banished central down here!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_POSTEIGHTUPDATE_03">You got it.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_SEVEN_01">They're trying to split our forces. Stay sharp.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_SEVEN_02">Head them off fast before they can detonate!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_SEVEN_03">I hate those guys. Take them out from range, you don’t want to be close when they pop.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_SIX_01">I’ve seen those before. 'Building killers'. Let's take it out before it levels home base!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_SIX_09">Defend the base, troops!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_THREE_02">I guess it’s time for a change of scenery. Move it, troops!</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAD_WAVE_THREE_03">Looks like we've bought ourselves a little time. Let’s check our defenses and call in some more troops while we have the chance.</str>
	<str id="M05_PIP_SPAJ_PREP_01">Good to hear. We're making our way now. Keep that carrier busy for us.</str>
