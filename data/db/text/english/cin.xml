    <str id="CIN_01_AND_DECK_02">I&apos;m sorry Captain.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_AND_DECK_03">It&apos;s good to see you too.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_AND_DECK_04">But just, look at it.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_AND_DECK_05">No idea. Our astronavigation system can&apos;t pinpoint a location. We&apos;re not on the map any more.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_AND_DECK_06">Our slipspace drive is gone. However we got here, it wasn&apos;t us who initiated the trip.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_AND_DECK_07_SPLIT01">S</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_AND_DECK_07_SPLIT02">...must have opened the portal from this end and pulled us in.</str>

    <str id="CIN_01_AND_DECK_08_SPLIT04">...do have a rough location.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_AND_DECK_08_SPLIT05">Should be simple enough to triangulate once we can pick up the signal from the ground.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_COMCR_DECK_01">Captain Cutter, sir.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_COMCR_DECK_02">We&apos;ve received a signal from the surface.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_COMCR_DECK_03">It&apos;s UNSC!</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_COMCR_DECK_04">I&apos;m sorry, Captain. I can&apos;t play it for you sir. The message has an encryption scheme we haven&apos;t seen before.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_01">Good morning to you too, Professor.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_02">What is it, and where are we?</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_03">We didn&apos;t drift out of the galaxy in twenty-eight years, Professor.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_04">Sensor records show we arrived via slipspace less than an hour ago?</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_05">Signal to my location, Lieutenant. Let&apos;s hear what they have to say.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_06_SPLIT01">S</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_06_SPLIT02">...but it is coming through on a UNSC frequency.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_06_SPLIT03">This is good. When we left, the war wasn&apos;t going well. This signal means the UNSC is still fighting. Or maybe we even won.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_06_SPLIT04">What&apos;s the source of the transmission?</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_07_SPLIT01">Cutter to Jerome.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_07_SPLIT02">Prep Spartan Red Team and a small recon squad. Professor Anders will send you coordinates.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_07_SPLIT03">Find out who&apos;s sending that signal. Be on the ground within the hour, travel light.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_08_SPLIT01">T</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_CUT_DECK_08_SPLIT02">...Let&apos;s see what kind of galaxy we woke up to.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_01">Captain, wake up. Something has happened.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_02_SPLIT01">T</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_02_SPLIT02">...could not anticipate.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_02_SPLIT03">I&apos;m certain Professor Anders would enjoy that little admission, so let&apos;s keep it between us, shall we?</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_03_SPLIT01">We&apos;ve been adrift for just over twenty-eight years.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_03_SPLIT02">I&apos;ve made quite a few repairs while you were sleeping, so ship&apos;s systems are one hundred percent.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_04">Cryo worked well and medstats on all remaining crew are green.</str>

    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_06_SPLIT01">I took care of my own arrangements rather than wake you.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_06_SPLIT02">I</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_06_SPLIT03">...well, I hope you can forgive this final breach of protocol.</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_07">It was a pleasure and an honor to serve with you, sir. Do look after everyone for me, would you?</str>
    <str id="CIN_01_SER_WAKEUP_08">Goodbye, Captain.</str>

    <str id="CIN_05_AND_PLAN_01">I think I&apos;ve found a way to get help</str>

    <str id="CIN_06_OUTPM_FLASHBACK_05">What are you doing?!</str>
    <str id="CIN_06_OUTPM_FLASHBACK_06">Isabel!</str>

    <str id="CIN_06_OUTPM_FLASHBACK_08">ISABEL!</str>
    <str id="CIN_06_SHIP_AFTERMATH_01">Y</str>
    <str id="CIN_06_SHIP_AFTERMATH_02">Enough to honor our contract.</str>
    <str id="CIN_06_SHIP_AFTERMATH_03">But how...?</str>
    <str id="CIN_06_SPAJ_CARRIER_01">Problem?</str>
    <str id="CIN_06_SPAJ_CARRIER_02">Let&apos;s get to work. Our entrance wasn&apos;t exactly subtle.</str>
    <str id="CIN_06_SPAJ_ESCAPE_01">Isabel. It&apos;s done...time to go home.</str>
    <str id="CIN_06_SPAJ_ESCAPE_02">Not as busy as you.</str>
    <str id="CIN_06_SPAJ_ESCAPE_03">You. You hold on.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_AND_FINALE_01">I hope this works.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_AND_FINALE_02">With all due respect, Spartan...</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_AND_FINALE_03">I don&apos;t believe that&apos;s an option any longer.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_AND_FINALE_04">D</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_AND_FINALE_05">It should only be a few weeks until I can figure out how to get back to you.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_CUT_FINALE_01">Professor Anders, there must be some way to...</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_CUT_FINALE_02">Professor?!</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_CUT_FINALE_03">The other teams are clear?</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_CUT_FINALE_04">Bring up the map. We have a lot of work to do until she gets back.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_ISA_FINALE_01">Captain...</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_ISA_FINALE_02">Yes, sir. ETA to the Spirit of Fire is five minutes.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_ISA_FINALE_03">Aye, Captain.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SOLDF_FINALE_01">O</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SOLDF_FINALE_02">H</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SOLDM_FINALE_01">W</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SOLDM_FINALE_2">Are you freaking kidding me?</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SPAA_FINALE_01">Lieutenant, they&apos;ve got siege units on their way.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SPAA_FINALE_02">Well that feels a bit like cheating.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SPAD_FINALE_01">West flank, we have them in position.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SPAD_FINALE_02">Banished has siege units inbound.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SPAJ_FINALE_01">Professor! It&apos;s now or never!</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SPAJ_FINALE_02">Show us what you got.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SPAJ_FINALE_03">Captain. It&apos;s done.</str>
    <str id="CIN_07_SPAJ_FINALE_04">Professor Anders, we are on our way. Get to the rendezvous.</str>
    <str id="CIN_08_AND_HALO_01">What&apos;s happening? Why did we drop out of slipspace?</str>
    <str id="CIN_08_AND_HALO_02">Oh, good job Ellen...</str>
    <str id="CIN_08_AND_HALO_03">You may have been safer on the Ark.</str>
