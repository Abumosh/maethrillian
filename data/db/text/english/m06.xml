    <str id="M06_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_BASESTART_01">You heard Isabel, let&apos;s make sure we&apos;re ready for them. If we lose our base we won&apos;t have the reinforcements to take the grav-lift.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_CRASHED_01">Isabel, are you still with me?</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_CRASHED_02">Getting to that grav-lift isn&apos;t going to be as easy as we hoped.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_KODIAKSFIRING_05">Roger that, Douglas. Now get your troops clear. You don&apos;t want to be down there when Isabel and I are finished.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_KODIAKSFIRING_06">That goes for you too, Alice. This is it, Isabel. Are you ready?</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_PELICANFLYIN_01">We&apos;re approaching the LZ for the grav-lift now. Are you ready for this, Isabel?</str>

    <str id="M06_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_PELICANFLYIN_03">Hold on, we&apos;re going down!</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_SNIPERPROMPT_01">Let&apos;s get a sniper out there.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_ISA_BANISHED_BASE_01">Jerome, the grav-lift is behind that Banished base, it&apos;s sitting right in our way.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_ISA_CHAT_02">I wasn&apos;t around for the war with the Covenant, so this is a bit of a steep learning curve.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_ISA_FIRSTCONTACT_01">Just don&apos;t do anything crazy, okay?</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_ISA_GRAVLIFT_01">Those turrets are still active around the grav-lift, Jerome. We&apos;re going to need some heavy armor to destroy them.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_MAR03_MEET_JEROME_01">A</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SNIP_APPROACH_BANISHED_BASE_01">We should get in close and spot for the Kodiaks. They&apos;ll make quick work of the base defenses.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SNIP_ENEMYINCOMING_ADD01">Suicide Grunts! Take them out from range!</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SNIP_JEROMENEARBY_ADD01">Jerome&apos;s Pelican crashed just up ahead, team.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SNIP_RENDEZVOUS_W_JEROME_01">Watch out, the Banished are deploying cloaked mines. Step carefully and clear them out as you go.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SNIP_SNIPERSABILITY_ADD01">We know the Banished are using cloaking technology, but your detectors should be able to spot any hidden units.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SNIPER_GRAV_LIFT_01">Sniper team, this is Sergeant Allieri. The Banished defenses got the drop on us and grounded Jerome and Isabel&apos;s Pelican on the way to the grav lift.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SNIPER_GRAV_LIFT_02">Get to the crash site and rendezvous with them for new orders.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_ALICEINTRO_01">I copy, Jerome. It&apos;s about time too. I was beginning to think you wanted to win this war on your own.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_ALICEINTRO_03">Copy that. I&apos;ve got Kodiaks ready and waiting.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_ALICEINTRO_04">Ok, we can station Kodiaks at these three points so we can hit those turrets simultaneously.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_ALICEINTRO_05">You&apos;ll be able to get across before the Banished have even noticed.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_ALICEINTRO_06">Ah, you know me better than that.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_BANISHEDTURRETS_01">The Banished have turrets stationed everywhere, if our Kodiaks get caught in the open, they&apos;ll be torn apart.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_ENERGY_SHIELD_01">They&apos;re setting up more defenses. Kodiaks, target those generators and fire at will.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_GRAVLIFT_01">Roger that, Jerome. Will alert you when all Kodiaks are in place.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_KODIAKDAMAGED_01">One of our Kodiaks has taken damage. Marines, get it repaired!</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_KODIAKLOCATION_01">That&apos;s the first location. Let&apos;s get one of our Kodiaks deployed there.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_KODIAKLOCATION_02">Now move out on the second and third locations. Keep those Kodiaks protected, the enemy knows we&apos;re coming.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_KODIAKSECONDLOCATION_01">We&apos;re coming up on the second deployment location, team. Get another Kodiak into position and push on to the final point.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_KODIAKSSUICIDEGRUNTS_01">Take out those Hunters before they reach the Kodiaks!</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_KODIAKTHIRDLOCATION_01">That&apos;s the final location. Deploy the Kodiak and stand by on my orders.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_PROTECTKODIAKS_01">Get those Kodiaks out of there! The turrets are tearing them apart!</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_TARGETKODIAKS_01">O</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAA_WATCHKODIAKS_01">Roll out, team. I&apos;ll jump in if you get into any trouble. Let&apos;s protect those Kodiaks.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAD_CARRIER_SHIELD_HIT_01">Jerome, this is Douglas. We&apos;ve got a confirmed hit on the carrier&apos;s shields. It&apos;s going to take a while to punch through but it&apos;s working.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_ALICEINTRO_02">Wouldn&apos;t want to spoil your fun, Alice. The Banished are defending their grav-lift with anti-air turrets.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_ALICEINTRO_03">I have Isabel with me, so I can&apos;t risk a frontal assault and a Pelican won&apos;t make it past those guns. I need someone to flank them and take them out.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_ALICEINTRO_05">Good luck.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_BANISHED_BASE_01">Not for long.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_CARRIER_SHIELD_HIT_02">Good to hear. We&apos;re making our way towards the base now. Keep them busy for us.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_CHAT_02">You&apos;re part of the Spirit of Fire now, Isabel. Welcome to the war.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_CHAT_03">How are you doing, Isabel?</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_CONVOY_01">Well, this was your plan, Isabel, and the only way to get you on board that carrier is to have you ride alongside me. Don&apos;t worry, I don&apos;t plan on losing.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_FIRSTCONTACT_01">Here we go, Isabel. Hang tight, this is going to get messy.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_FIRSTCONTACT_02">No promises.</str>
    <str id="M06_PIP_SPAJ_GRAVLIFT_02">That&apos;s what Alice is here for. One-Three-Zero, do you copy? We&apos;re ready.</str>

    <str id="M06_SPAA_PU_ENERGY_SHIELD_01">They&apos;re setting up more defenses. Kodiaks, can you hit those generators for us?</str>
