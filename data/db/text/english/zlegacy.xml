	<str id="23252">Rhinos are in position and ready to fire! Firing Rhinos in 3...2...1!</str>
	<str id="23253">Firing Rhinos!</str>
	<str id="23254">Not much effect, but it looks like we're making some progress!</str>
	<str id="23255">We've got a lot more Dropships approaching!</str>
	<str id="23256">I've marked the third position.</str>
	<str id="23257">We're going to need a transport to get the Rhino to that position.</str>
	<str id="23258">ODSTs on the way.</str>
	<str id="23259">Rhinos ready! Firing in 3..2..1!</str>
	<str id="23260" />
	<str id="23261">Holy hell, they have Locusts!</str>
	<str id="23262">Hmmm. My calculations show that two more Rhinos will be necessary to open a hole big enough. The final two positions have been marked.</str>
	<str id="23263">I've marked the forth and fifth postions.</str>
	<str id="23264">The Covenant must have figured out what we are doing. We're going to need a larger force to take those locations!</str>
	<str id="23265">Let's crack this egg!</str>
	<str id="23266">Cross your fingers! Firing all Rhinos in 3...2...1!</str>
	<str id="23267" />
	<str id="23268">All right! The dome generators and air defenses are the main targets. Light 'em up!</str>

	<str id="23319">The Spirit's power core is almost repaired.</str>
	<str id="23321">They're attacking with both aircraft and ground troops. We should upgrade our turrets to counter appropriately.</str>
	<str id="23322">The power core is destroyed; we've lost the ship. Serina, begin emergency evacuation sequence.</str>
	<str id="23323">The power core is fully repaired. Serina, best speed away.</str>
	<str id="23324">Forge, use Cyclopses to repair the power core while you defend against Covenant attacks!</str>

	<str id="23331">Destroy the Super Scarab</str>
	<str id="23333">It can't fire in two directions at once; maybe we can use that to our advantage.</str>
	<str id="23334">The Scarab is about half dead, or half alive. Take your pick.</str>
	<str id="23335">The temple ruins in this area will provide some cover, but not forever.</str>
	<str id="23338">The Scarab's searchlight beam shows the direction it's facing.</str>
	<str id="23339">Build up a base and army, and go kill that Scarab.</str>
	<str id="23342">The Scarab's head is moving even slower now - keep it up.</str>
	<str id="23343">The head is tracking more slowly.</str>
	<str id="23344">Your Command Center has been destroyed. You have failed.</str>
	<str id="23345">The Scarab is destroyed. Victory is ours today.</str>
	<str id="23347">You've advanced to where the forcefield stood. Take a look around.</str>
	<str id="23349">If that thing burns through that barrier of ruins and destroys our Command Center, we're dead.</str>
	<str id="23350">You've destroyed a power node. The Scarab's head is turning a little more slowly.</str>
	<str id="23353">What was that?</str>
	<str id="23355">Destroy those Locusts wherever you find them - they're building-killers.</str>
	<str id="23356">The Scarab is incomplete but its head is operational. Its field of fire prevents any chance of retreat or extraction - you'll have to destroy it.</str>
	<str id="23358">The Scarab's weapon system is relying on the power nodes in this area. Destroy them to reduce the Scarab's combat effectiveness.</str>
	<str id="23359">Open the Portal</str>
	<str id="23360">Activate the second door across from this one.</str>
	<str id="23361">One set of doors is open. Open the remaining two pairs of doors.</str>
	<str id="23362">One pair of doors remain. Open them to free Spirit of Fire.</str>
	<str id="23363">If we don't get that door open before the sun goes critical we're dead.</str>
	<str id="23364">Use the nodes at the edge of the door to reactivate them.</str>
	<str id="23365">There must be some pattern to opening the doors.</str>
	<str id="23366">The Forerunner lettering seems to be paired across two door sections. Maybe that's the key...</str>
	<str id="23367">One set down, two more to go.</str>
	<str id="23368">It seems you can activate only one pair of doors at a time</str>
	<str id="23369">The Sentinels are attracted to the activated nodes. You're going to have to work quickly</str>
	<str id="23370">It seems the Sentinels are more worried about the Flood than us. Get them to fight each other and we may buy ourselves some time.</str>
	<str id="23371">The planet is tearing itself apart - keep an eye out for debris.</str>
	<str id="23372">Good work! We may survive this after all...</str>
	<str id="23373">The Sentinel A.I. is shutting the doors; it has enacted a planetwide alarm of some kind. The whole planet is locking down!</str>
	<str id="23374">The Sentinels seem to be combining into larger forms. If this continues they may become unstoppable.</str>
	<str id="23375">The Sentinels have evolved again.</str>
	<str id="23376">Flood infections detected near you area.</str>
	<str id="23377">Debris is falling your way - look out!</str>
	<str id="23378">What are they doing? They're combining!</str>
	<str id="23379">Sentinels! Incoming!</str>
	<str id="23380">Get that door open - we only have one shot at this!</str>
	<str id="23381">We won't be able to send any supplies this time. Requisition as much of an army as you can muster and get the door open.</str>
	<str id="23382">You don't have much time left - get those last doors open!</str>
	<str id="23383">Kill the Flood Pod</str>
	<str id="23384">Ah perfect - there's a stinkin' Covenant Outpost right where you marked. We better take that out first.</str>
	<str id="23386">Forge, get out there and get those things off my ship!</str>
	<str id="23387">Sentinel drones, attacking from the front!</str>
	<str id="23388">Serina, report. What's going on here?</str>
	<str id="23392">You can requisition troops from the airlocks on the deck. If we lose those airlocks we'll be defenseless.</str>
	<str id="23393">What... is... that?</str>
	<str id="23394">The drones are leaving. Serina, what's going on here?</str>
	<str id="23395">Take that thing out. We've got to get the ship out of here</str>
	<str id="23396">Excellent work.</str>
	<str id="23399">If we lose all the airlocks, we'll lose the ship.</str>
	<str id="234">Requires 4 Reactors</str>
	<str id="23400">Best guess? We're being pulled through some sort of docking system.</str>
	<str id="23401">That alien life form has followed us in. We have a significant infestation on the aft quarter.</str>
	<str id="23402">Those aliens are dropping pods on the hull from all around us - keep watch for them.</str>
	<str id="23403">Alien population on the hull is increasing and the structure is reacting...more of those drones inbound too.</str>
	<str id="23404">I'm detecting some sort of alarm from the planet's A.I. Something's coming.</str>
	<str id="23405">Flood levels are rising. I'm also picking up high energy readings...coming from the tunnel.</str>
	<str id="23406">That's not good...</str>
	<str id="23407">Sergeant Forge, get your men into the airlocks. Something very bad is coming.</str>
	<str id="23408">A large enemy object is approaching. Scans indicate a drone variant. It's blocking the exit.</str>
	<str id="23409">The ring is coming again! Take cover!</str>
	<str id="23410">No problem. I told you we'd make it.</str>
	<str id="23411">We're losing the ship.</str>
	<str id="23412">Security barrier breached. High-order infection detected. Unidentified alien intrusion detected. Initiating Stage 3 defense protocols.</str>

	<str id="23808">To construct your first building, press $$A$$ at the building site indicated.</str>
	<str id="23809">Selecting any building site brings up the BUILDING MENU. Use the LEFT STICK $$LS$$ to highlight the Supply Pad.</str>

	<str id="23811">Good. Unlike Crates, Supply Pads provide a steady stream of resources.</str>
	<str id="23812">It takes quite a few Supplies to make an army, so it's usually good to have more than one Supply Pad. Build another one over here.</str>
	<str id="23813">Right on.</str>
	<str id="23814">Now let's train some Marines. Marines come from a Barracks. Build a Barracks over here.</str>
	<str id="23815">Select the Barracks and train a squad of Marines.</str>
	<str id="23816">Use the LEFT STICK $$LS$$ to highlight the Marines and then press $$A$$ to start the training.</str>

	<str id="23858">Awesome.</str>
	<str id="23859">Well, those are the basics. Feel free to keep playing against the A.I. opponent. We'll give you a few more pointers as you explore.</str>

	<str id="23867">You should get some armor on the battlefield. Build a Vehicle Depot and train a Scorpion Tank.</str>

	<str id="24469">Eradicator</str>
	<str id="24470">Eradicator description</str>
	<str id="24471">Anti-Flood unit</str>
	<str id="24472">Scattered pockets of Marines are isolated and under attack near Alpha Base. Locate as many as you can and kill the Covenant forces that are attacking them; the Marines will be needed to retake Alpha Base.</str>
	<str id="24473">The Covenant have erected an energy barrier across the pass leading to Alpha Base. The barrier will block vehicles, but Marines can move through and destroy the power source beyond.</str>
	<str id="24474">Alpha Base is the key UNSC installation on Harvest. Covenant forces have completely overrun the facility. Defeating the Covenant units in the area is a top priority.</str>
	<str id="24475">Grunts, called Unggoy in the Covenant language, are cowardly but dangerous in large numbers. Methane breathers, they are commonly seen in Covenant infantry squads. Counter them with your own infantry, or with Flamethrowers.</str>
	<str id="24476">The Covenant attack has heavily damaged Alpha Base. Get it back up and running by building Supply Pads and military buildings.</str>
	<str id="24477">A Supply Pad is a key component of any military base. Stockpiling supplies will let us build additional structures and train military forces.</str>
	<str id="24478">A Barracks at Alpha Base will allow military units to be trained there.</str>
	<str id="24479">With enough boots on the ground, Alpha Base will be safe once more. After the Marines are trained, patrols can be sent out and the surrounding area secured.</str>
	<str id="24480">The structure is north of Alpha Base, past the Covenant forces. You will have to fight your way through enemy forces to get there.</str>
	<str id="24481">The Covenant were after the secrets buried in the Forerunner structure. Enter and learn what you can.</str>
	<str id="24482">The Covenant are planning to destroy the Forerunner structure. Take out the detonator.</str>
	<str id="24483">Jackals are birdlike aliens who serve as Covenant scouts and sharpshooters. Lacking durability, they often carry energy shields. Counter them with armed Warthogs or Flamethrowers.</str>
	<str id="24484">The Covenant are refining methane on Harvest to supply their Grunt squads. Taking out the refinery would slow them down.</str>
	<str id="24485">Several UNSC units are trapped. Rescue them to bolster your forces.</str>
	<str id="24486">Anders will need time to activate the hardlight bridge. Keep the Covenant forces at bay until she succeeds.</str>
	<str id="24487">Get Forge and Anders to the exit. The Covenant will overwhelm you if you wait too long.</str>
	<str id="24488">Anders may still be able to activate the second bridge and give the UNSC forces a chance to escape.</str>
	<str id="24489">It is vital that Anders returns to Spirit of Fire with the information from the Forerunner structure. Get her and Forge to the landing zone ASAP.</str>
	<str id="24490">Forge and his troops can only hold off the Covenant for so long. They will need support, rescue, and extraction.</str>
	<str id="24491">Deactivating the bridge will drop any units trying to cross it into the chasm below. Use this information to your advantage.</str>
	<str id="24492">Hunters are collective colonies of small creatures packed into assault armor. Strong and fast, and typically travelling in pairs, Hunters are used to destroy enemy vehicles. Counter them with infantry or air power.</str>
	<str id="24493">Eliminate the Covenant forces around the subway exit so the civilians have a clear path to the transports.</str>
	<str id="24494">The civilians will head toward the transports on their own. At least one of the transport ships must survive; the city’s population has no other way to evacuate the area.</str>
	<str id="24495">A base in the city will let you train more units to protect the civilians and transports. If you can assemble enough of a force, it might even be possible to launch a limited counterattack against the Covenant.</str>
	<str id="24496">Elites, also known as Sangheili, are often seen leading Covenant forces into battle. Using their cloaks and energy swords to surprise and overwhelm their enemies, Elites are challenging opponents.</str>
	<str id="24497">Covenant forces are swarming all over the crater. Take out all the enemies and create a safe zone.</str>
	<str id="24498">Additional UNSC forces are on approach to your location. The crater is excellent defensive terrain; hold fast, maintain a base in the crater, and wait for help.</str>
	<str id="24499">Covenant forces are closing in. Get to the southern crater and try to hold out.</str>
	<str id="245">Requires 5 Monuments</str>
	<str id="24500">If the Covenant base is destroyed, the UNSC position on Arcadia will be secure. All of the base buildings and any nearby Covenant units must be eliminated.</str>
	<str id="24501">More production capacity would give you a fighting chance to defeat the Covenant. If the crater is secure, try to claim an additional base.</str>
	<str id="24502">The Wraith is a heavy vehicle equipped with a plasma mortar. Used at the forefront of ground assaults, they are a critical component of the Covenant arsenal. Counter them with Cobras.</str>
	<str id="24503">The Covenant are attacking in force. Fight off the assault.</str>
	<str id="24504">You will need to get several Rhinos in position to be able to bring enough firepower to bear on the dome. Rhinos will be dropped at the landing pad.</str>
	<str id="24505">Positions for the Rhinos are marked. Protect each Rhino until it can safely deploy at the marked destination. The Spirit of Fire menu has an option that allows you to use Pelicans to transport Rhinos.</str>
	<str id="24506">The Rhinos are all in position. Wipe out the enemy structures and bring down the dome.</str>
	<str id="24507">A fast-moving flying unit, the Banshee is highly maneuverable. Equipped with plasma cannon, it provides deadly and effective air support for Covenant forces. Counter Banshees with Wolverines.</str>
	<str id="24508">Taking control of the nearby ONI Reactors will let you train advanced troops more quickly.</str>
	<str id="24509">The Scarab must be destroyed before it wipes out your base. Keep your forces out of the head's line of fire.</str>
	<str id="24510">The nodes are secondary power sources for the Scarab. If they are destroyed, the Scarab will not be able to turn its head as quickly.</str>
	<str id="24511">The spider-like Locust is slow-moving but powerful. It is designed to destroy structures, and is less effective against units. Counter the Locust with Marines or Scorpions.</str>
	<str id="24512">Spirit's forces must secure the marked location for a base. This planet's atmosphere is highly unusual; use caution and stay alert for signs of trouble.</str>
	<str id="24513">The Elephant is a fully equipped mobile training center. Once deployed, it can mobilize infantry and serve as a forward base.</str>
	<str id="24514">The Elephants are extremely valuable military hardware and must be retrieved at all costs. Send your forces out to recover them.</str>
	<str id="24515">The first stage of a mysterious alien life form, it is highly aggressive and dangerous. The infection forms attempt to penetrate the spinal cords of their victims. They can be countered by massed fire from virtually any military unit.</str>
	<str id="24516">The Spartans have gone ahead, following Anders' signal. Link up with them and reinforce their position before it's too late.</str>
	<str id="24517">Anders' signal is up ahead. Send patrols forward to locate and rescue her.</str>
	<str id="24518">Data analysis suggests that killing the pods should weaken the larger infection form. Taking out as many pods as possible is the safest tactical approach.</str>
	<str id="24519">Once enough of the pods are destroyed, the primary infection should be engaged. Use caution - even after it has been weakened, it is still an extremely dangerous opponent.</str>
	<str id="24520">These alien lifeforms are possibly providing nutrients to the smaller infection variants. They are easily destroyed by any unit.</str>
	<str id="24521">Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie platoons have been cut off beyond the areas overrun by the Flood. Your soldiers will have to clear a path through the Flood and bring them back to the LZ.</str>
	<str id="24522">Escort the platoon back through the Flood-infested areas. Watch out for any infection forms and keep them away from your infantry.</str>
	<str id="24523">A Gremlin may be able to temporarily disrupt the pylons and delay the automatic docking procedure. In theory, this should buy Spirit of Fire more time.</str>
	<str id="24524">Optional: Kill 350 Swarms</str>
	<str id="24525">UNSC weapons can damage, but not completely destroy, the alien structures. Only the tunnel's technology can permanently clear the forms off Spirit’s hull.</str>
	<str id="24526">The Flood must not be allowed to breach the airlocks. If the airlocks are destroyed, we will not be able to send reinforcements and the Flood may move in between the outer and inner hulls of the Spirit of Fire.</str>
	<str id="24527">Flood structures have attached themselves to the outside of Spirit of Fire's hull, and are threatening to break through the airlocks. Destroy them all before they infect the ship.</str>
	<str id="24528">The airlocks provide some cover for our infantry. Order them inside.</str>
	<str id="24529">Controlled by some sort of A.I., these small high-tech constructions appear to be designed to contain the infection forms. Counter them with any military unit.</str>
	<str id="24530">We're almost out - the exit is in sight.</str>
	<str id="24531">That thing is blocking our escape. Take it down, and bring us up to flank speed. We'll leave these drones behind us.</str>
	<str id="24532">Serina, maximum power to the engines. Get us out of here!</str>
	<str id="24533">The ring is helping clear the infestation from the hull. We just have to hold those aliens off until it can clean the ship.</str>
	<str id="24535">Bad news. I intercepted a signal from the alien A.I. Those drones have declared us a threat and are massing behind us.</str>
	<str id="24537">Something big is coming...</str>
	<str id="24538">Take cover!</str>
	<str id="24539">What the...get in the airlocks or we're all dead!</str>
	<str id="24540">The ring is back!</str>

	<str id="24957">Sergeant Forge makes a startling discovery while Professor Anders prepares to go down to the surface of the planet. Meanwhile, the Arbiter is ordered to destroy the Forerunner installation.</str>
	<str id="24958">Professor Anders and Sergeant Forge activate the Forerunner installation.</str>
	<str id="24959">The information from Harvest points the crew of Spirit of Fire towards Arcadia, another UNSC colony world. When Spirit of Fire arrives, the world is already under attack by the Covenant.</str>
	<str id="24960">The Arbiter is ordered to capture Professor Anders.</str>
	<str id="24961">The Covenant have built a shield on the surface of Arcadia and the crew debate how to find out what they are hiding.</str>
	<str id="24962">Professor Anders is kidnapped by the Covenant. Spirit of Fire pursues her kidnappers deep into enemy space.</str>
	<str id="24963">Serina accidently unlocks the secret of the Shield World and opens the entrance portal, dragging Spirit of Fire inside the planet.</str>
	<str id="24964">The entrance to the Shield World closes behind Spirit of Fire while the ship descends deep into the planet.</str>
	<str id="24965">Spirit of Fire enters the interior of the Shield World and collides with a Covenant destroyer.</str>
	<str id="24966">Professor Anders is forced to unlock the Forerunner dreadnaught ships and escapes to the surface.</str>
	<str id="24967">The crew decides to detonate their FTL reactor in order to stop the Covenant from using the Forerunner dreadnaughts.</str>
	<str id="24968">In a final confrontation between the Arbiter and Sergeant Forge, the reactor is damaged and one of the crew must make the ultimate sacrifice.</str>

	<str id="24970">Professor Anders enters cryo sleep under protest.</str>
	<str id="24971">In Halo Wars, you (the player) are in control of single units, as well as large armies. You can give those units simple orders to move, attack, or use their special abilities. Ultimately, your goal is to use your units and armies to complete objectives and win scenarios.</str>
	<str id="24972">Bases in Halo Wars are very important to your success. You choose which buildings you want to build and upgrade at your base. Buildings at your base can be used to train and upgrade units, creating powerful armies to fight the enemy. But don’t forget - the enemy is doing the same thing and it’s all happening in real time.</str>
	<str id="24973">The ship Spirit of Fire is always in orbit above the planet. The ship’s special powers can be called upon to get out of sticky situations. As you progress through the campaign, check this menu to see which powers are available to you. Some of the powers at your fingertips will include Heal and Repair, Carpet Bombing, and a giant MAC Cannon blast.</str>
	<str id="24974">The areas of the map that are black or “foggy” are places you either have not been or do not have line of sight. You can select and move your units into these areas to obtain line of sight. Remember, the black map goes away if you have been there but the fog of war remains unless one of your units has line of sight to the area.</str>
	<str id="24975">Spirit of Fire was heavily damaged in the collision. The power center must be repaired and brought back online before the ship can disengage.</str>
	<str id="24976">A Spirit is the Covenant dropship, used for transporting infantry and support troops. Spirits carry groups of Covenant units to battle.</str>
	<str id="24977">The deck guns are helping to hold back the Covenant assault. Keep as many as possible intact.</str>
	<str id="24978">Professor Anders must be rescued. Push forward and secure the landing zone.</str>

	<str id="24980">Hold the landing zone at all costs. If your forces are overrun, all hope is lost.</str>
	<str id="24981">The Scarab is a powerful Covenant super weapon. If captured, it would provide much-needed support for our forces. Only Spartans are capable of capturing the Scarab.</str>
	<str id="24982">The alien bomber forms are a threat to our ground forces. Counter them with Wolverines.</str>
	<str id="24984">If Spirit of Fire is going to escape from the Forerunner structure, the door must be opened. The unlocking mechanism appears to be some sort of giant puzzle.</str>
	<str id="24985">A heavily armored walker designed to smash through enemy armies, the Scarab is a nearly unstoppable killing machine. If one appears on the battlefield, the best counters are Scorpions and Cobras.</str>

	<str id="25209">Who am I in Halo Wars?</str>
	<str id="25210">In Halo Wars, you (the player) are in control of single units, as well as large armies. You can give those units simple orders to move, attack, or use their special abilities. Ultimately, your goal is to use your units and armies to complete objectives and win scenarios.</str>
	<str id="25211">Bases in Halo Wars</str>
	<str id="25212">Bases in Halo Wars are very important to your success. You choose which buildings you want to build and upgrade at your base. Buildings at your base can be used to train and upgrade units, creating powerful armies to fight the enemy. But don’t forget - the enemy is doing the same thing and it’s all happening in real time.</str>
	<str id="25213">The Spirit of Fire</str>
	<str id="25214">The ship Spirit of Fire is always in orbit above the planet. The ship’s special powers can be called upon to get out of sticky situations. As you progress through the campaign, check this menu to see which powers are available to you. Some of the powers at your fingertips will include Heal and Repair, Carpet Bombing, and a giant MAC Cannon blast.</str>
	<str id="25215">Black Map and Fog of War</str>
	<str id="25216">Some areas of the map are black or “foggy.” The black map goes away once your units have explored the area, but the fog of war remains unless you have line of sight to the area with one of your units.</str>

	<str id="25387">The Halo Wars servers are currently unavailable. The game will use a default set of matchmaking types until the servers become available.</str>
	<str id="25388">The enemy units near the interlock towers appear to be preventing them from working. They appear to function if humans are nearby, but other life forms must be cleared from the area.</str>
	<str id="25389">The nodes appear to be laid out in some sort of pattern. If they can be activated in the correct sequence, the portal door sections may open.</str>

	<str id="25394">Welcome to the Halo Wars tutorial. It will teach you the basic commands and controls used to play Halo Wars.</str>
	<str id="25395">Let's start with controlling the camera so you can find your way around the map.</str>
	<str id="25396">You will simply move the $$LS$$ in the direction you want the camera to go.</str>
	<str id="25397">See if you can move the camera to the three flares that the blue objective arrow points to.</str>
	<str id="25398">Great! Now let’s learn how to select your units.</str>
	<str id="25399">You will use what you learned about controlling the camera to center the crosshair in the middle of the screen over what you want to select.</str>
	<str id="25400">Perfect! Now you have a unit selected and you can see the unit type at the bottom of the screen.</str>
	<str id="25401">Let’s issue a move order to the next smoke flare you see.</str>
	<str id="25402">Just move the crosshair to where you want the unit to go and press $$X$$.</str>
	<str id="25403">Notice that as your units move to new places on the map, the dark or fogged-over areas get revealed.</str>
	<str id="25404">Good! Just keep following the blue objective arrow.</str>
	<str id="25405">You now have more units to control. Select them all.</str>
	<str id="25406">You can do this by pressing the $$LB$$.</str>
	<str id="25407">Good! Now, using what you learned to move one unit, let’s move all of these units.</str>
	<str id="25408">Move the crosshair to where you want to go, then press $$X$$.</str>
	<str id="25409">Keep following the blue objective arrow to the last target.</str>
	<str id="25410">We need to get through that Covenant shield. Let’s order our army to attack the power source.</str>
	<str id="25411">Just like you did when you moved your units, select your units and move the crosshair over what you want to attack. Then press $$X$$.</str>
	<str id="25412">The shield is down! Follow the blue objective arrow and practice attacking some other targets.</str>
	<str id="25413">Remember, however, that some enemy targets in Halo Wars can fight back.</str>
	<str id="25414">These last targets seem much stronger.</str>
	<str id="25415">Luckily, some units in Halo Wars have special abilities.</str>
	<str id="25416">Try attacking this target using the $$Y$$ button instead of the $$X$$ button.</str>
	<str id="25417">Excellent!</str>
	<str id="25418">This ends the basic controls tutorial for Halo Wars. For more advanced controls, try playing the advanced tutorial.</str>

	<str id="25468">Press $$Y$$ to use Ram attack</str>
	<str id="25469">Welcome to the Halo Wars advanced tutorial. We will cover more advanced concepts that you can use to play Halo Wars.</str>
	<str id="25470">Select the Warthog, then follow the blue objective arrow to the first target.</str>
	<str id="25471">Good! Let’s start with the Warthog's Ram ability.</str>
	<str id="25472">Nice! Keep following the objective arrow and ram another target.</str>
	<str id="25473">In Halo Wars you are going to need supplies to buy and upgrade things.</str>
	<str id="25474">There are a few ways to get supplies. The first one we are going to learn is gathering supplies from crates.</str>
	<str id="25475">Follow the objective arrow to the next location.</str>
	<str id="25476">Gathering from crates increases your supplies.</str>
	<str id="25477">The amount of supplies you have is shown in the top right corner, next to the small crate icon.</str>
	<str id="25478">Okay - let’s gather these crates. Just move the crosshair over them and press $$X$$.</str>
	<str id="25479">Good! Now that we have some supplies we can start building some things at our base.</str>
	<str id="25480">Move the camera back to the UNSC base.</str>
	<str id="25481">Select the marked building site.</str>
	<str id="25482">Using $$LS$$, push and hold to highlight the Supply Pad, then press $$A$$ to begin building it.</str>
	<str id="25483">A Supply Pad is another way to get supplies.</str>
	<str id="25484">Go ahead and build a second Supply Pad so your supplies are coming in at a steady pace.</str>
	<str id="25485">Now your supplies should be coming in at a good rate.</str>
	<str id="25486">With all these supplies we are ready to start building an army, but we will need a Barracks first.</str>
	<str id="25487">Select a building site and build a Barracks.</str>
	<str id="25488">Good! Now we can start training an army.</str>
	<str id="25489">Select the Barracks and train five Marine Squads.</str>
	<str id="25490">You can queue up more than one Marine squad at a time by selecting them in the circle menu and pressing $$A$$ five times.</str>
	<str id="25491">Excellent! If you pan the camera to the front of your base you will see your army.</str>
	<str id="25492">Now let’s upgrade your army to make them more powerful.</str>
	<str id="25493">To do this we will need to select a building site and build a Reactor.</str>
	<str id="25494">Notice that you now have a number one by the small lightning bolt icon in the top right corner above your supply number.</str>
	<str id="25495">This is how many Reactors you have.</str>
	<str id="25496">Remember, as you increase your Reactor count, more units become available for you to train and upgrade.</str>
	<str id="25497">Having one Reactor will allow you to upgrade those Marines.</str>
	<str id="25498">Select the barracks and upgrade your Marines with the “New Blood” technology.</str>
	<str id="25499">Good! Now your Marines are upgraded.</str>
	<str id="25500">Let’s follow the objective arrow and learn about Leader Powers.</str>
	<str id="25501">The Covenant has been kind enough to stand here while we practice using some of the Leader Powers.</str>
	<str id="25502">Lets start with a UNSC MAC blast.</str>
	<str id="25503">Press up on $$DPAD$$ to see the Leader Power menu.</str>
	<str id="25504">Now select the MAC Blast and let’s blow up some stuff.</str>
	<str id="25505">We'll keep giving you additional MAC Blast shots, so just have fun until all the Wraiths are destroyed.</str>
	<str id="25506">Great! Now that you've learned to command the UNSC, we're going to jump over and show you how to lead the Covenant.</str>
	<str id="25507">The Covenant Leader Powers are different than the UNSC Leader Powers because they are treated like the Leader's $$Y$$ ability.</str>
	<str id="25508">The Prophet of Regret is trapped.</str>
	<str id="25509">Using his Cleansing Leader Power you will be able to free him.</str>
	<str id="25510">Select the Prophet and use his $$Y$$ ability to destroy the three power sources.</str>
	<str id="25511">Once you press $$Y$$ the power will begin and stay on screen. Then, using $$LS$$, steer the Cleansing beam around to the three Power Sources to destroy them.</str>
	<str id="25512">Free at last!</str>
	<str id="25513">To learn some more advanced features of Covenant upgrading we are going to jump to a Covenant base.</str>
	<str id="25514">Just press left on $$DPAD$$ to do this now.</str>
	<str id="25515">The Covenant base may look very different from the UNSC base but it works in a similar way.</str>
	<str id="25516">Select the building site and build a Factory.</str>
	<str id="25517">There are some powerful units that can be trained in the Factory but we need to upgrade the tech level before we can train some of them.</str>
	<str id="25518">Unlike the UNSC building Reactors to upgrade Tech Level, the Covenant upgrade Tech Level by researching Ages.</str>
	<str id="25519">Select the Temple and upgrade to the Age of Doubt.</str>
	<str id="25520">The Covenant can also research strong defenses.</str>
	<str id="25521">Select a building site and build a Shield Generator.</str>
	<str id="25522">As you can see, a shield has appeared around this base. Now it's time for an army!</str>
	<str id="25523">Select the Factory and train four Locusts.</str>
	<str id="25524">As your new Locusts train, send them into the Hot Drop Pad.</str>
	<str id="25525">They will instantly teleport to wherever your Covenant Leader is on the map.</str>
	<str id="25526">To quickly jump to your leader you can press up on $$DPAD$$.</str>
	<str id="25527">Excellent!</str>
	<str id="25528">Now select your Covenant army and go destroy the UNSC army nearby.</str>
	<str id="25529">Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Halo Wars advanced tutorial! You are ready to take on the universe!</str>

	<str id="25741">BASE</str>
	<str id="25742">Press $$A$$ to select</str>
	<str id="25743">The Marines' Grenade ability is useful for dealing a lot of damage to buildings or infantry.</str>
	<str id="25744">Flamethrowers can stun enemy infantry with their Flashbang ability.</str>
	<str id="25745">Spartans can hijack enemy vehicles with their Jack ability, adding their combat strength to the vehicle.</str>
	<str id="25746">Spartans have several upgrades that change their weapons from SMGs to a chain gun, and eventually to a Spartan laser.</str>
	<str id="25747">The UNSC Warthog is a fast unit that’s good for scouting and quickly gathering supply crates.</str>
	<str id="25748">Been bowled over lately? Use the Warthog’s Ram ability to knock enemy infantry units around the map.</str>
	<str id="25749">The main UNSC vehicle is the Scorpion. Its Canister Shell ability enhances its attack power against infantry.</str>
	<str id="25750">Cobras are very effective against other vehicles. Build them to neutralize enemy tanks.</str>
	<str id="25751">Cobras can lock down, which increases their range. Lock them down by enemy bases and shell the buildings from a distance.</str>
	<str id="25752">If you're having trouble dealing with enemy air power, try building Wolverines. They excel at taking down air units.</str>
	<str id="25753">The Hornet is the mainline UNSC air unit, and is effective at both offense and recon.</str>
	<str id="25754">The Vulture's Barrage ability is a deadly area attack with multiple missiles. Use Barrage against enemy groups or bases.</str>
	<str id="25755">The Elephant is difficult to destroy and can help lock down an area. Use it as a forward base.</str>
	<str id="25756">When Elephants are locked down, they can train infantry. Use them to quickly get fresh troops to the front lines.</str>
	<str id="25757">In addition to effectively damaging enemy buildings, the Cyclops can pick up and throw enemy units.</str>
	<str id="25758">The Cyclops was originally designed for heavy lifting at UNSC shipyards, but has recently been repurposed for combat roles.</str>
	<str id="25759">The Chain Amplifier upgrade allows the Gremlin to hit up to three targets with each EMP blast.</str>
	<str id="25760">Professor Anders' special unit, the lightly-armored Gremlin, is good against vehicles.</str>
	<str id="25761">The Hawk is an improved Hornet, available only to Professor Anders.</str>
	<str id="25762">The Grizzly is an upgraded Scorpion tank that is only available to Sergeant Forge.</str>
	<str id="25763">The ODST serves the same role as the Marine, but he's better in every way. ODST units are only available to Captain Cutter.</str>
	<str id="25764">Upgrades for Grunt squads will add additional Grunts and eventually give them Needlers.</str>
	<str id="25765">Jackals are effective in an anti-infantry role. Use them against enemy Marines or Grunts.</str>
	<str id="25766">Hunters are particularly good against vehicles, but they should be kept away from enemy aircraft.</str>
	<str id="25767">The Spirit Bond upgrade allows Hunter pairs to do bonus damage as long as both are alive.</str>
	<str id="25768">The Wraith is the Covenant's mainline vehicle. Its Heavy Shield upgrade deflects a percentage of incoming damage.</str>
	<str id="25769">The Covenant Locust, like the UNSC Cyclops, is primarily a building-killer.</str>
	<str id="25770">The Locust's Overdrive ability dramatically increases its attack power at the expense of its shields.</str>
	<str id="25771">When a Scarab appears on the battlefield, no enemy is safe. The Scarab can only be defeated by concentrated firepower.</str>
	<str id="25772">The Banshee is the Covenant's mainline air unit, and is effective against most targets except its direct counters.</str>
	<str id="25773">Use Vampires to counter enemy air units. Upgrade their Stasis ability and the Vampire will drain enemy hitpoints to heal itself.</str>
	<str id="25774">Engineers are the only known non-combatant Covenant race. Experts at repairing things, they heal damaged units.</str>
	<str id="25775">The Ghost is a fast, cheap scouting unit. Don't expect it to go toe-to-toe with most enemy units.</str>
	<str id="25776">The Brute Chopper is an improved heavy scout that is only available to the Brute Chieftan.</str>
	<str id="25777">The Brute's Electric Shot upgrade adds electrical stun damage to his weapon.</str>
	<str id="25778">The Suicide Grunt's high-damage special attack is effective against many types of units.</str>
	<str id="25779">The Arbiter's Rage power lets him cut through entire enemy armies.</str>
	<str id="25780">Not many people know that the Arbiter's given birth name is Shirley.</str>
	<str id="25781">The Arbiter's Ghastly Vision upgrade enables him to permanently cloak.</str>
	<str id="25782">The Prophets of Regret, Truth, and Mercy came to power in 2525, usurping the power of the previous Hierarchs.</str>
	<str id="25783">The Prophet's Cleansing ability does lots of damage to all types of enemy units.</str>
	<str id="25784">Want to enhance the Prophet's mobility? Get the Divine Absolution upgrade and he becomes a full-fledged flying unit!</str>
	<str id="25785">The Brute Chieftan likes Thornbeast for dinner, but it BETTER BE RARE.</str>
	<str id="25786">Use the Brute Chieftan's Vortex to damage large groups of enemies.</str>
	<str id="25787">The Brute Chieftan's Destiny upgrade adds an area of effect stun to his attacks.</str>
	<str id="25788">Try slipping cloaked Elites behind enemy forces to strike at their weaker support units.</str>
	<str id="25789">Use the Wraith's Scorch ability to deny an angle of approach to enemy forces.</str>
	<str id="25790">Banshees with the Sacrifice ability will crash into a ground target when destroyed, doing area of effect damage.</str>
	<str id="25791">The Engineer's State of Grace upgrade dramatically improves its ability to heal.</str>
	<str id="25792">Put your infantry in cover whenever you can. Cover increases their range, line of sight, and hitpoints.</str>
	<str id="25793">$$LS$$ is used to move around the map.</str>
	<str id="25794">Pressing $$LS$$ will send a flare to your allies. This is useful for quickly telling an ally where you plan to attack.</str>
	<str id="25795">If you flare a location, your A.I. ally will try to help attack or defend there.</str>
	<str id="25796">Proper use of Rally Points allows you to get fresh units to the front lines. Try both Global Rally Points and Rally Points set from bases.</str>
	<str id="25797">Double-clicking $$LS$$ will set your Global Rally Point to that location.</str>
	<str id="25798">$$RS$$ is used to manipulate the rotation and zoom of your camera. Press it once to reset to the default view.</str>
	<str id="25799">$$DPAD$$ is used to jump around the map quickly. Advanced players will use it more often than $$LS$$.</str>
	<str id="25800">Want to quickly jump to your Covenant leader? Press UP on $$DPAD$$.</str>
	<str id="25801">If you want to cycle through the last few alert messages, press RIGHT on $$DPAD$$.</str>
	<str id="25802">Jump from base to base by pressing LEFT on $$DPAD$$.</str>
	<str id="25803">Pressing DOWN on $$DPAD$$ will cycle you through all your armies around the map. This is helpful when planning a multi-front assault.</str>
	<str id="25804">Selecting a unit is easy with the $$A$$ button, but you can also hold down the $$A$$ button to get a paint brush that will select any unit it touches.</str>
	<str id="25805">Group selection and management is important in Halo Wars. To select all the units on the screen, press $$RB$$.</str>
	<str id="25806">Want to select all the units in the game at one time? Press $$LB$$.</str>
	<str id="25807">$$RT$$ is used to cycle through the unit types you have selected. Expert players will use this to give orders to individual unit types.</str>
	<str id="25808">Need to move around the map quickly? Hold down $$LT$$ when you scroll with $$LS$$ to quadruple camera speed.</str>
	<str id="25809">Want to cancel a selection or close a menu? Press $$B$$.</str>
	<str id="25811">$$Y$$ is the secondary ability button. Most units have secondary abilities that dramatically alter what you can do with those units.</str>
	<str id="25812">At any point in the campaign, you can see your objectives by pressing the BACK button.</str>
	<str id="25813">Pause the game with the START button. This will let you change options or turn on Skulls during a game.</str>
	<str id="25814">Move commands can be queued up for sequential execution by briefly holding down $$X$$ when giving commands.</str>
	<str id="25815">The circular menu that comes up when you select buildings or Spirit of Fire is called, oddly enough, the Circle Menu.</str>
	<str id="25816">When you select any unit, it tells you what type of unit it is. This can be invaluable in deciding how to counter your enemy’s forces.</str>
	<str id="25817">In Skirmish games, UNSC players can choose between Captain Cutter, Sergeant Forge, or Professor Anders. Each comes with several unique additions that alter play style.</str>
	<str id="25818">The Covenant has three leaders to choose from for a Skirmish game: the Arbiter, the Prophet of Regret, and the Brute Chieftain.</str>
	<str id="25819">Unlike the UNSC leaders, each Covenant leader personally appears on the battlefield.</str>
	<str id="25820">The UNSC army is professional and regimented. Overall, each UNSC unit is slightly stronger than each Covenant unit.</str>
	<str id="25821">The Covenant forces are led by charismatic leaders who drive their zealous followers to fight against humanity with little concern for any individual’s well being.</str>
	<str id="25822">While each Covenant unit is somewhat weaker than an equivalent UNSC soldier, the overall Covenant army size is bigger than the UNSC army size.</str>
	<str id="25823">The Covenant leaders are the strongest units on the battlefield, though a well-managed group of three Spartans can do a lot of damage too.</str>
	<str id="25824">UNSC and Covenant leader powers can be upgraded with technologies. Some upgrades even add new abilities.</str>
	<str id="25825">Covenant leaders are upgraded at the Temple.  Each upgrade increases the leader’s combat power and adds interesting new passive abilities.</str>
	<str id="25826">Covenant leader powers cost few Supplies to invoke, but require additional Supplies to keep active. Be careful not to spend all your Supplies on one power!</str>
	<str id="25827">Captain Cutter can call down the MAC Blast power from Spirit of Fire. Akin to an oversized sniper rifle, the MAC Blast is great for taking out single targets.</str>
	<str id="25828">Every new base Captain Cutter builds starts one level higher than normal.</str>
	<str id="25829">The Elephant is Captain Cutter’s unique unit. He can also upgrade his Marines to ODST super units.</str>
	<str id="25830">Sergeant Forge’s unique power is the Carpet Bomb. It’s the ultimate fiery grenade for ground units.</str>
	<str id="25831">With the Cyclops unique unit and Grizzly upgrade, Sergeant Forge displays his fondness for strategies with a focus on heavy units.</str>
	<str id="25832">Sergeant Forge’s Supply Pads cost more than normal Supply Pads, but they start with the Heavy Supply Pad upgrade, resulting in a faster mid-game economy.</str>
	<str id="25833">The Cryo Bomb is the main Spirit of Fire power for Professor Anders. It freezes ground units in their tracks and can knock flying units out of the air.</str>
	<str id="25834">Fancy units are the thing for Professor Anders. The Gremlin unique unit can immobilize other ground vehicles while the Hawk super unit can dominate the sky.</str>
	<str id="25835">Because of Professor Anders' science background, her research into unit and leader power upgrades is completed more quickly and at a reduced cost.</str>
	<str id="25836">The Arbiter’s Rage Power channels his irrepressible evil into one long fatality string. Use $$RS$$ to initiate quick-jump fatalities in this mode.</str>
	<str id="25837">Befitting his disregard for his troops, the Arbiter’s unique unit is the Suicide Grunt squad. The Suicide Grunts' special ability detonates their methane tanks.</str>
	<str id="25838">The Prophet of Regret can call down the massive Cleansing Power. This beam of energy, even in its weakest form, is pure devastation for anything it hits.</str>
	<str id="25839">Elite Honor Guards protect the Prophet and serve as his unique unit. Equipped with the Cloak ability, these Elites are excellent for sneak attacks.</str>
	<str id="25840">The Prophet of Regret’s third combat upgrade converts his floating chair into a flying chair, giving him exciting new tactical potential.</str>
	<str id="25841">The Brute Chieftain’s Power is the gravity-related Vortex. Steer it around the combat zone to pull in enemies, then unleash the stored power with $$A$$.</str>
	<str id="25842">Jet Pack Brutes complement the Brute Chieftain leader. These heavy infantry units can use their jet packs to cross impassable terrain.</str>
	<str id="25843">Halo Wars has a Rock-Paper-Scissors balance between the unit types. Vehicles beat infantry, aircraft beat vehicles, and infantry beat aircraft.</str>
	<str id="25844">Counter-units are great at killing one type of unit, but are worse against any other unit. One counter-unit example is the anti-infantry UNSC Flamethrower.</str>
	<str id="25845">Remember to multi-task in Halo Wars. Units will continue to think on their own even if you’re off someplace else.</str>
	<str id="25846">The Fog of War covers the areas of the map that your units cannot currently see. Scout frequently to make sure you know what your enemies are up to.</str>
	<str id="25847">Did you know you can increase the troop limit? You can find the technologies that do that in the UNSC Field Armory and Covenant Temple.</str>
	<str id="25848">If you're looking for a quick way to select your units, try either $$RB$$ (all units on screen) or $$LB$$ (all units in the world).</str>
	<str id="25849">Different units require different amounts of resources, tech levels, and available army space to train. Stronger units usually cost more and require more army space.</str>
	<str id="25850">To try a rush strategy, attack quickly and aggressively. Train military units as soon as possible, apply pressure to the enemy's base, and don't let up until you win.</str>
	<str id="25851">To try a boom strategy, build only a few cheap scouting units to take control of additional bases. Build Supply Pads in all bases to maximize your economy before building up your military.</str>
	<str id="25852">To try a turtle strategy, build towers at the front of your base and upgrade your Command Center. Use the base defenses to stall the enemy until your technology allows you to train vehicles or air units.</str>
	<str id="25853">If you’d like access to better units and upgrades, you need to improve your tech level. Build Reactors as the UNSC or research the Temple’s Age upgrades as the Covenant.</str>
	<str id="25854">Try to match up counter units against the units they can best kill. For instance, use Cobras to take on enemy Wraiths and Ghosts.</str>
	<str id="25855">Most strategies should involve building at least two types of units. This approach will give you some sort of answer for the majority of enemy units.</str>
	<str id="25856">Want a simple strategy? Focus on building just one type of mainline unit and upgrading it all the way quickly.</str>
	<str id="25857">Don't ignore the postgame statistics. You can learn a lot about how you can improve your game.</str>
	<str id="25858">Ensemble Studios was founded in 1996.</str>
	<str id="25859">Tips appear here. Really.</str>
	<str id="25860">Once a Skull is activated, it will remain on until the end of the scenario.</str>
	<str id="25861">Score Multiplier:</str>
	<str id="25862">Powers Fully Upgraded</str>
	<str id="25863">You can tell crates are being gathered when you see small crate icons rising up. A wrench icon will also appear above the gathering unit.</str>

	<str id="25866">Subtitles - In-game Chats</str>
	<str id="25867">Turns on subtitles for in-game chats.</str>
	<str id="25868">If you're playing as the Arbiter, try running him near the enemy base and then hot-dropping Suicide Grunts to blow up a few buildings.</str>
	<str id="25869">If you're playing as the Covenant, try a leader rush. Just build a Temple and Warehouses, then attack the enemy base with the leader's special ability.</str>
	<str id="25870">Try the Elephant rush! Build one Elephant and then lots of Supply Pads. Lock down the Elephant just outside your opponent's base and churn out Marines.</str>
	<str id="25871">If you're playing as Anders, Gremlins and Flamethrowers are a devastating combination in large groups.</str>
	<str id="25872">Jackals and Hunters complement each other well.</str>
	<str id="25873">When playing as Forge, try massing Flamethrowers, and then using your Carpet Bomb to kill enemies that can counter the Flamethrowers.</str>
	<str id="25874">One simple boom strategy would be to build four or five Hellbringers and use them to grab map-specific buildings and additional bases.</str>
	<str id="25875">If you micromanage the Prophet of Regret and give him time to recharge his shields, he can take out the enemies around map-specific buildings all by himself.</str>
	<str id="25876">The Brute Chopper is stronger than either the Ghost or the Warthog.</str>
	<str id="25877">Covenant buildings and bases are naturally weaker than their UNSC counterparts. Be sure to add a Shield Generator.</str>
	<str id="25878">Kill enemies around map-specific buildings with your Covenant leader to gain veterancy levels.</str>
	<str id="25879">Whenever you have a free building site and you're not sure what to build, a Supply Pad or a Warehouse is always a good choice.</str>
	<str id="25881">Garrisoning infantry in a Forerunner Bonus Reactor is a great way to advance your tech level without having to build a Reactor or purchase a Temple upgrade.</str>
	<str id="25882">Garrisoning infantry inside a Forerunner Supply Elevator grants a nice boost to supply resources.</str>
	<str id="25883">The Protector Plant offers a selection of protector units that can boost the unit you attach them to with bonus shields, healing, or firepower.</str>
	<str id="25884">You can purchase Forerunner Sentinel units, including the unit-disabling Super Sentinel, at the Sentinel Factory.</str>
	<str id="25885">If you have damaged units, moving them near a Forerunner Spire Of Healing will quickly get them back to full health.</str>
	<str id="25886">Controlling the Forerunner Lifesupport Pod will allow you to build larger armies by increasing your population limit.</str>
	<str id="25887">Garrisoning infantry in an Energy Wall will create a barrier that will deny mobility to ground units. This can help you hold ground or block choke points.</str>
	<str id="25888">Sending units into a Forerunner Teleporter instantly moves them to another teleporter location. A flare on your minimap will help you see where your units have reappeared.</str>
	<str id="25889">The team that controls a Mega Turret is a force to be reckoned with. Garrison infantry inside and blast away.</str>
	<str id="25890">Sniper Towers are great defensive structures. An infantry squad inside can stand their ground against forces that would normally overwhelm them.</str>
	<str id="25891">Minibase locations let you gain extra building sites by allowing you to construct a single building on them.</str>
	<str id="25892">Fortify areas away from your base by building on stand-alone turret sites. Once claimed, these turret locations will match the upgrade level of your own turrets.</str>

	<str id="26069">This mode starts out the same way a standard skirmish game begins.  At random intervals, a Forerunner flag unit will spawn somewhere on the map.  The flag is marked with a white star on the minimap, and will move to random locations.  Tasking a unit on the flag will order the unit to grab and carry the flag.  Once a unit is carrying the flag, a 'Keep Away' timer starts.  If the flag-carrying unit is alive when the timer runs down, the carrying unit’s team will earn extra resources and a capture point.  Be careful when your team controls and moves the flag carrier – the enemy team will have full line-of-sight to the flag carrier at all times.  The game is won if one team reaches a certain number of captures, but the game can still be won if the enemy team is defeated.  If a flag carrier is killed, a new flag will spawn shortly afterwards.</str>
	<str id="26070">Tug of War is very similar to the normal skirmish mode, except every unit produced, building built, and resource collected is factored into a team’s strength.  At the start of the game, both teams are at equal strength.  'The Tug of War bar' at the top left of the screen displays the current strength ratio between the two teams.  If your team’s strength gets far enough ahead of the other team’s strength, you win.</str>
	<str id="26071">In this mode, a timer shows when the next wave of reinforcements will arrive.  Once the timer ticks down, all stockpiled supplies are taken away; players then receive a group of troops at their base, along with an extra 250 supplies.  The number of troops delivered is determined by how many stockpiled supplies the player had when the timer expired, while the troop types are dependent on the player’s current tech level.  The only troops players can purchase directly in this mode are Spartans and Covenant leader units.  Players will still have to build troop production building to purchase upgrades for their units.  Place your global rally point near the base where you want your troops delivered.</str>
