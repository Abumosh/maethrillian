    <str id="M07_IGC_PIP_SPAD_SCARAB_INTRO_01">It&apos;ll be a pleasure.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_AND_EXPLAINBARRIER_01">The Banished have blocked all routes to that access point. We&apos;ll have to find a way to break through.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_BANBASEDESTROYED_01">We need you on the installation. We may have stopped the Banished flow of reinforcements, but Atriox already has a sizeable force on the ring.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_BANBASEDESTROYED_SPLIT_01">Use the access point to get yourselves to the ring and set a charge to destroy it behind you. Jerome is already en route, report to him when you arrive.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_BARRIERDOWN_01">Good work Spartan. Now push forward and take out that Banished base</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_DESTROYBASE_02">Take that base down, we&apos;re going to need every edge to push forward.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_ESTABLISHBASE_01">Get a base ready, you&apos;re going to need additional troops to support that Scarab.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_FINALBARRIER_02">G</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_FINALBARRIER_04">It&apos;s vital you destroy those bases, team. If we don&apos;t stop the Banished reinforcing that Halo, our troops there will have no chance to hold it.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_MISSIONFAIL_SCARABDEAD_01">We&apos;ve lost the Scarab, abort mission! We need another plan.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_MISSIONFAIL_TIME_01">We&apos;re too late, team. We can&apos;t beat the Banished forces now.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_ODSTDROP_01">I&apos;m dropping in some ODSTs to support you.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_PROTECTSCARAB_01">Douglas, that Scarab is still vulnerable to air and anti-vehicle units. Make sure you have a support force to respond quickly to attacks. We cannot afford to lose it.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_PROTECTSCARAB_02">Alice, protect that Scarab until it&apos;s destroyed the barricades and cleared a path through for our troops.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_SCARABREMINDER_03">I</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_SKULLSUCCESS_01">Impressive work, Spartan!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_CUT_SQUADINTRO_01">Support&apos;s on it&apos;s way, hang on.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_EHONG_ORBITALSTRIKE_01">You shall not take our Scarab, demons! Shipmaster, I have the human&apos;s location!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_BANBASEDESTROYED_01">You did it! They won&apos;t be able to send any more of their troops!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_FINALBARRIER_03">The Banished have established bases at the edge of the Foundry.  They&apos;re sending troops up to the Halo using the nearby access point.</str>

    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_SCARABREMINDER_01">Better hurry up, they&apos;re moving more troops to that Scarab. I think it&apos;s nearly repaired.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_SCARABWARLORD_01">Spartans, the Banished have an Honor Guard overseeing the repair of the Scarab.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_SCARABWARLORD_SPLIT_01">I</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMELIMIT_01">And by my estimation, we don&apos;t have long.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMEWARNING_01">We&apos;ve got to destroy that base before it&apos;s too late!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMEWARNING_02">Hurry! Every minute we lose, we&apos;re losing ground to the Banished!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMEWARNING_03">The Banished are still loading troops onto the Halo! We&apos;re running out of time!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMEWARNING_04">We haven&apos;t much time left, Spartans!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMEWARNING_05">If we don&apos;t destroy that base soon, we won&apos;t be able to stop the Banished!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_MARSQ_SQUADINTRO_01">Hold them back! Spirit of Fire, we need back up! We can&apos;t hold out much longer!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_MARSQ_SQUADUPDATE_01">Thanks, Spartans. We haven&apos;t been able to make much headway since we&apos;ve been here!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_MARSQ_SQUADUPDATE_03">This I gotta see. You&apos;ve got our guns.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_BANISHBASEATTACK_01">Douglas - let&apos;s clean house.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_BANSHEEWAVE_01">Banshees! Keep them away from the Scarab!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_BARRIERDOWN_01">Move in, troops!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_DESTROYBARRIER_01">Douglas, destroy that barrier! We don&apos;t all have a Scarab, remember!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_DESTROYBASE_04">Then let&apos;s make sure we win.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_FINALBARRIER_05">We&apos;ll deal with the gatecrashers, sir.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_HONORGUARDDOPWN_01">The Honor Guard is out of the picture! Douglas, you&apos;re up!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_MOREBLISTERBACK_01">We&apos;ve got another Blisterback nearby!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_MOREBLISTERBACK_02">Taking heavy fire. Take out that Blisterback!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_PICKAROUTE_01">Douglas, there&apos;s only one more barricade between us and the access point. Find the safest route, I&apos;ve got your back.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_SCARABAPPROACH_01">Too bad! Just line &apos;em up and knock &apos;em down!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_SCARABREMINDER_03">O</str>

    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANBASEDESTROYED_02">Yes, sir. It&apos;ll be good to get the whole team back together again.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANBASEDESTROYED_03">Well, it was fun while it lasted.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANISHBASEATTACK_02">I hear that.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANISHBASEATTACK_03">Another base down, lets push onto the Halo Forge</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANISHBASEATTACK_04">Banished base detected, dead ahead.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANSHEEWAVE_02">B</str>

    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BARRIERDOWN_03">I&apos;ve opened up another route, we are good to go!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BARRIERDOWN_04">Barricade destroyed and path clear!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BLISTERBACKVALLEY_01">They&apos;ve got Blisterbacks guarding the valley. They&apos;ll bombard us all the way to the Scarab if we don&apos;t take them out now.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_DESTROYBASE_03">Sounds like this is the big one, partner.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBARRIER_01">Spirit of Fire Actual, the barricade is cleared. We&apos;ve got a path to the Foundry now, sir.</str>

    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_PICKAROUTE_01">I think &apos;safe&apos; is a relative term, partner.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_PROTECTSCARAB_01">Copy that, sir.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABAPPROACH_01">They really don&apos;t want us getting to that Scarab!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABFUN_01">Alice, we have to get you one of these too!</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABFUN_02">Sorry, one side, coming through.</str>
    <str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABFUN_03">Think I just stepped in something.</str>
