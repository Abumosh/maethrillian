	<str id="M07_BLIST_BLISTERBACK_01">Digging in!</str>
	<str id="M07_EHONG_SCARABWARLORD_01">You destroyed our carrier, demons! I shall see your remains scattered to the winds!</str>
	<str id="M07_EHONG_SCARABWARLORD_02">I, Val'Saham, will return to my clan with your heads.</str>
	<str id="M07_EHONG_SCARABWARLORD_03">This is for my fallen brothers!</str>
	<str id="M07_GRUNT_BLISTERBACK_01">Blisterbacks! That'll show the big bullies!</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_AND_SCARABFALLEN_01">The Banished have a Scarab nearby, but it's out of commision for now.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_AND_SCARABFALLEN_02">It must have been damaged trying to escape the carrier Isabel destroyed.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_CUT_BARRICADE_02">We don't have time to try and blast our way through, every second we wait, the Banished are moving more troops onto the ring through that access point.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_CUT_BREAKBARRICADE_01">Use that Scarab to break the barricade so we can stop the Banished reaching that access point!</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_CUT_SCARAB_CAPTURE_03">Use that Scarab to break the barrier so our troops can reach the Banished base, Douglas.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_CUT_SCARAB_INTRO_01">I know just the people for the job. Alice, Douglas? Fight your way through and capture that Scarab.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_CUT_SCARAB_INTRO_SPLIT_01">We've got to reach the Foundry and stop the Banished boarding the ring.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_ISA_SCARAB_INTRO_01">That Scarab’s plasma beam could easily destroy the Banished barricades. If we could capture it, that is.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_JACK_BARRICADE_01">Spirit of Fire Actual, I can't find a single breach in the Banished's barricade.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_SHIP_SCARAB_CAPTURE_02">It’s not enough to take our ship, now you've captured our Scarab. It won't save you.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_SHIPM_SCARAB_CAPTURE_SPLIT_02">Many of my clan perished when you destroyed my carrier - our home! That is a debt you will repay a thousandfold. You will…</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_SPAA_SCARAB_INTRO_01">Got it. Douglas, let's make a mess of them.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_SPAD_SCARAB_CAPTURE_01">Now, this is more like it!</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_SPAD_SCARAB_CAPTURE_02">I've got a signal incoming on the Scarab's comms.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_SPAD_SCARAB_CAPTURE_03">Seriously! With the talking...Now, let's go smash something.</str>
	<str id="M07_IGC_PIP_SPAD_SCARAB_INTRO_01">It'll be a pleasure.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_AND_EXPLAINBARRIER_01">The Banished have blocked all routes to that access point. We'll have to find a way to break through.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_BANBASEDESTROYED_01">We need you on the installation. We may have stopped the Banished flow of reinforcements, but Atriox already has a sizeable force on the ring.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_BANBASEDESTROYED_SPLIT_01">Use the access point to get yourselves to the ring and set a charge to destroy it behind you. Jerome is already en route, report to him when you arrive.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_BARRIERDOWN_01">Good work Spartan. Now push forward and take out that Banished base</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_DESTROYBASE_02">Take that base down, we're going to need every edge to push forward.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_ESTABLISHBASE_01">Get a base ready, you're going to need additional troops to support that Scarab.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_FINALBARRIER_02">Good work, team. Keep that Scarab functioning, we can’t afford to lose it now!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_FINALBARRIER_04">It's vital you destroy those bases, team. If we don't stop the Banished reinforcing that Halo, our troops there will have no chance to hold it.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_MISSIONFAIL_SCARABDEAD_01">We've lost the Scarab, abort mission! We need another plan.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_MISSIONFAIL_TIME_01">We're too late, team. We can't beat the Banished forces now.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_ODSTDROP_01">I'm dropping in some ODSTs to support you.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_PROTECTSCARAB_01">Douglas, that Scarab is still vulnerable to air and anti-vehicle units. Make sure you have a support force to respond quickly to attacks. We cannot afford to lose it.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_PROTECTSCARAB_02">Alice, protect that Scarab until it's destroyed the barricades and cleared a path through for our troops.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_SCARABREMINDER_03">If we don't get there before the Banished repair it, there’ll be no way for us to breach their defenses.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_SKULLSUCCESS_01">Impressive work, Spartan!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_CUT_SQUADINTRO_01">Support's on it's way, hang on.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_EHONG_ORBITALSTRIKE_01">You shall not take our Scarab, demons! Shipmaster, I have the human's location!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_BANBASEDESTROYED_01">You did it! They won't be able to send any more of their troops!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_FINALBARRIER_03">The Banished have established bases at the edge of the Foundry.  They're sending troops up to the Halo using the nearby access point.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_OPTIONALOBJECTIVE_01">Keep destroying those facilities and they’ll have fewer troops to put on the Halo!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_OPTIONALOBJECTIVE_02">Another facility down!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_OPTIONALOBJECTIVE_03">That's all the Banished's facilities down, great work!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_ORBITALSTRIKE_01">Watch out! You've got incoming!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_SCARABREMINDER_01">Better hurry up, they're moving more troops to that Scarab. I think it's nearly repaired.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_SCARABWARLORD_01">Spartans, the Banished have an Honor Guard overseeing the repair of the Scarab.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_SCARABWARLORD_SPLIT_01">If you take him down it’ll break his communication with the Engineers, and give you an opening to capture the Scarab.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMELIMIT_01">And by my estimation, we don't have long.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMEWARNING_01">We've got to destroy that base before it's too late!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMEWARNING_02">Hurry! Every minute we lose, we're losing ground to the Banished!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMEWARNING_03">The Banished are still loading troops onto the Halo! We're running out of time!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMEWARNING_04">We haven't much time left, Spartans!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_ISA_TIMEWARNING_05">If we don't destroy that base soon, we won't be able to stop the Banished!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_MARSQ_SQUADINTRO_01">Hold them back! Spirit of Fire, we need back up! We can't hold out much longer!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_MARSQ_SQUADUPDATE_01">Thanks, Spartans. We haven't been able to make much headway since we've been here!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_MARSQ_SQUADUPDATE_03">This I gotta see. You've got our guns.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_BANISHBASEATTACK_01">Douglas - let's clean house.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_BANSHEEWAVE_01">Banshees! Keep them away from the Scarab!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_BARRIERDOWN_01">Move in, troops!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_DESTROYBARRIER_01">Douglas, destroy that barrier! We don't all have a Scarab, remember!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_DESTROYBASE_04">Then let's make sure we win.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_FINALBARRIER_05">We'll deal with the gatecrashers, sir.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_HONORGUARDDOPWN_01">The Honor Guard is out of the picture! Douglas, you're up!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_MOREBLISTERBACK_01">We've got another Blisterback nearby!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_MOREBLISTERBACK_02">Taking heavy fire. Take out that Blisterback!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_PICKAROUTE_01">Douglas, there's only one more barricade between us and the access point. Find the safest route, I've got your back.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_SCARABAPPROACH_01">Too bad! Just line 'em up and knock 'em down!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_SCARABREMINDER_03">Okay, you’re up. One of us should stay on the ground, anyways. Don't say I never give you anything.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_SCARABWARLORD_01">An Elite, talking too much? I guess some things didn’t change while we were away.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_SQUADUPDATE_02">We’ve got new orders. We’re going to capture a Scarab so we can take down the barricades.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAA_WELCOMEPARTY_01">We've got a welcome party waiting for us!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANBASEDESTROYED_01">I enjoyed that, sir. What are our next orders?</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANBASEDESTROYED_02">Yes, sir. It'll be good to get the whole team back together again.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANBASEDESTROYED_03">Well, it was fun while it lasted.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANISHBASEATTACK_02">I hear that.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANISHBASEATTACK_03">Another base down, lets push onto the Halo Forge</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANISHBASEATTACK_04">Banished base detected, dead ahead.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BANSHEEWAVE_02">Banshees incoming! Keep them off me, I’m a little busy!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BARRIERDOWN_01">Barricade's down, Alice. Send them in!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BARRIERDOWN_03">I've opened up another route, we are good to go!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BARRIERDOWN_04">Barricade destroyed and path clear!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_BLISTERBACKVALLEY_01">They've got Blisterbacks guarding the valley. They'll bombard us all the way to the Scarab if we don't take them out now.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_DESTROYBASE_03">Sounds like this is the big one, partner.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBARRIER_01">Spirit of Fire Actual, the barricade is cleared. We've got a path to the Foundry now, sir.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_01">Blisterbacks on the way!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_02">Watch out, we've got Blisterbacks!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_03">Heads up, Blisterbacks!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_04">Watch it, Blisterbacks incoming!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_05">Blisterbacks deploying, watch out!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_06">They're deploying Blisterbacks!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_07">The Banished are digging in with Blisterbacks!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_08">Blisterback artillery deploying!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_09">Banshees!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_10">Watch out, Douglas! Banshees!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_11">I've got Banshees!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_FINALBASEWAVE_12">They're sending in Banshees!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_MOREBLISTERBACK_01">Artillery deploying, take out those Blisterbacks fast!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_MOREBLISTERBACK_02">More Blisterbacks inbound!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_PICKAROUTE_01">I think 'safe' is a relative term, partner.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_PROTECTSCARAB_01">Copy that, sir.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABAPPROACH_01">They really don't want us getting to that Scarab!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABFUN_01">Alice, we have to get you one of these too!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABFUN_02">Sorry, one side, coming through.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABFUN_03">Think I just stepped in something.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABFUN_04">This sure beats a Warthog!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABREMINDER_02">You know, Alice, I've always wanted to drive one of those things...</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SCARABWARLORD_01">Excellent. It's been a while since I tussled with an Honor Guard.</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SQUADINTRO_01">Put us down here, pilot!</str>
	<str id="M07_PIP_SPAD_SQUADUPDATE_01">We're here to change that.</str>
