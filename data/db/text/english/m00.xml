    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAJ_LEGSTRETCH_02">Alice is right, we don&apos;t know what&apos;s waiting for us down there. Keep your eyes out for trouble.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAJ_JUMPY_01">Hang on!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAJ_GETTOSIGNAL_01">We&apos;ll know more when we get to the source of that signal.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAJ_BOMBING_RUN_01">More plasma burns. They didn&apos;t leave much standing.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAJ_BANPORTAL_01">Professor, we&apos;ve found some more portals, but there&apos;s something strange about them.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAJ_AIWAKE_01">We&apos;re getting you out of here, Isabel, sit tight.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAJ_ACTIVATE_LIGHTBRIDGE_01">That&apos;s our way across, let&apos;s get that bridge activated.</str>

    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAD_SITREP_01">Knocking a Pelican out of the sky? That&apos;s serious artillery.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAD_SEARCH_01">There&apos;s always a chance, Alice. If they&apos;re here, we&apos;ll find &apos;em.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAD_MOVEPROMPT">As much as I&apos;m enjoying the scenery, we should get moving towards that signal.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAD_INVESTIGATE_01">I see plasma burns - lots of them. Looks like Covenant work.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAD_DOWNBIRD_01">W</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_WELCOME_01">Jerome, these aren&apos;t military defenses.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_UNSCBUILDINGS_01">These are research buildings. No defenses. The people here weren&apos;t soldiers, they were scientists.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_SITREP_01">Looks like we may see some action after all.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_SEARCH_01">C</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_MOVEPROMPT">The captain&apos;s expecting us to find that signal, we need to get moving.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_LEGSTRETCH_01">You saw this place on the drop down, Douglas. Nothing real about it.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_KEEPMOVING_05">Get this crate moving, Spartan! Go!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_KEEPMOVING_04">Keep it rolling, Jerome!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_KEEPMOVING_03">Move it! Let&apos;s go!</str>

    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_KEEPMOVING_01">Keep moving, Jerome! We&apos;ve got to get Isabel to the Spirit of Fire!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_INVESTIGATE_01">Whoever it was, it looks like they&apos;re long gone.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_SPAA_AIWAKE_01">Then we&apos;re coming back for that Brute!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_REC3_SITREP_01">It&apos;s one of our recon teams, sir. We found them like this when we arrived. Didn&apos;t see what hit them.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_MARSQ_WELCOME_SPLIT_01">I don&apos;t know what they were defending against, but there&apos;s some heavy duty barricades here.</str>

    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_RIP_01">D</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_LAMB_01">Henry Lamb Research Outpost&apos;. Spirit of Fire, we&apos;re outside. Base looks clear from out here. Let&apos;s see who&apos;s been calling.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_FLYBY_01">Looking forward to shaking off some cobwebs, sir.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_EVAC_01">We can find out later, right now we need to get Douglas and Isabel back to the Spirit of Fire. Spirit of Fire Actual, we could use a little more help.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_BROKECONTROL_05">How we doing, Alice?</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_BROKECONTROL_03">Spirit of Fire actual, we&apos;re at the evac zone, I have Isabel and I&apos;m loading Douglas now.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_BROKECONTROL_02">Make it quick, they&apos;re closing in!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAJ_BROKECONTROL_01">The controls to the bridge! Alice, now!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAA_MYBRIDGE_01">Too slow!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAA_EVAC_01">What was that?</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAA_BRUPORTAL_02">Portals. Why is it always portals?</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAA_BRUPORTAL_01">Watch out, over there!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAA_BROKECONTROL_06">I&apos;m setting the controls so the bridge will deactivate once you&apos;re across!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAA_BROKECONTROL_03">That&apos;s it, move! I&apos;ll cover you!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAA_BROKECONTROL_02">A</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_SPAA_BROKECONTROL_01">On it!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_PELIC_FLYBY_02">Standby for drop, Red Team.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_PELIC_FLYBY_01">Spirit of Fire Actual, I am approaching the drop zone with Red Team.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_ISA_RIP_01">She&apos;s gone!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_ISA_BRUPORTAL_01">They&apos;re using the Ark&apos;s portals!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_CUT_EVAC_01">Understood, I&apos;m sending coordinates of your evac zone. We&apos;ve found an open spot near a beach about a half a klick ahead of you.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_CUT_ALICEBACK_SPLIT_02">We need to find out everything she knows.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_IGC_CUT_ALICEBACK_02">We have a medical team standing by for Douglas, Jerome. I want a full report from you and that AI as soon as you get back to the Spirit of Fire.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_CUT_KEEPMOVING_02">Jerome, I need you to get back here ASAP. We can&apos;t afford to lose that AI!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_CUT_KEEPMOVING_01">Keep moving, Red Team! Now&apos;s not the time to make a stand!</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_CUT_INVESTIGATE_SPLIT_01">I&apos;ve ordered the rest of our forces to stay back and protect your exit while you investigate.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_CUT_INVESTIGATE_01">Jerome, our recon teams scouted out this portal that will take you down to that signal.</str>
    <str id="M00_PIP_AND_BANPORTAL_01">Odd, they look like they&apos;ve been modified, and those machines attached to them aren&apos;t UNSC tech. Keep an eye out for any more of them.</str>
    <str id="M00_MARSQ_RECONPOOL_06">Sweep the area, I want a report on every square foot of this site!</str>
    <str id="M00_MARSQ_RECONPOOL_01">Get this site secure for Red Team, marines!</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR04_VERTIGO_01">Phew, check out that drop!</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR04_SOUND_01">Did you hear that? You heard that, right?</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR04_RECONPOOL_10">Looks like a surprise attack to me.</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR04_RECONPOOL_05">You think these are the same folks who sent the signal?</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR03_VERTIGO_01">You check it out, I&apos;d like to hang on to my breakfast.</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR03_RECONPOOL_12">Nothing but ashes. Let&apos;s just find that signal so we can get back home.</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR03_RECONPOOL_09">No supplies over here, just some scientific equipment.</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR03_RECONPOOL_04">We&apos;ve not found any bodies among the wreckage, sir.</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR02_SOUND_01">I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;m hearing in this place. I just know I don&apos;t like it.</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR02_RECONPOOL_08">W</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR02_RECONPOOL_03">T</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR01_RECONPOOL_11">I was hoping we&apos;d find a friendly face down here, but this...</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR01_RECONPOOL_07">It must have been the Covenant. I guess we&apos;re still at war.</str>
    <str id="M00_MAR01_RECONPOOL_02">I&apos;ve found some more wreckage over here, sir!</str>
    <str id="M00_GRUNT_GRUJUMP_02">Which one&apos;s &apos;the big one&apos;?</str>
    <str id="M00_GRUNT_AITAUNT_01">I thought there was supposed to be an army?</str>
    <str id="M00_GRUN2_AITAUNT_01">They don&apos;t look so tough!</str>
    <str id="M00_COMMS_SPAD_LEGSTRETCH_01">Ah, it feels good to have our feet back on real ground again, doesn&apos;t it, Alice?</str>
    <str id="M00_BRUTE_GRUJUMP_02">I&apos;ll take the big one!</str>
    <str id="M00_BRUTE_GRUJUMP_01">Slay the cowards!</str>
    <str id="M00_BRUTE_AITAUNT_01">Haha, running meat!</str>
